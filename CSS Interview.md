# CSS: Definition, Purpose, Syntax, and Example

## CSS Definition

**CSS** stands for **C**ascading **S**tyle **S**heets.

  * **Cascading:** Refers to the way styles are applied based on a hierarchy of rules. When multiple styles conflict, CSS determines which rule takes precedence based on factors like specificity, importance, and source order.
  * **Style:** Dictates how HTML elements are presented visually (e.g., colors, fonts, layout, spacing).
  * **Sheets:** Styles are typically stored in separate files (stylesheets) for better organization and reusability across multiple HTML documents.

In essence, CSS is a **stylesheet language** used to describe the **presentation** of a document written in HTML (or XML). It allows developers to control the look and feel of web pages independently of their structural content.

## CSS Purpose

The primary purposes of CSS are:

1.  **Separation of Concerns:** To separate the presentation (look and feel) of a web page from its content and structure (HTML). This makes HTML cleaner, more readable, and easier to maintain.
2.  **Visual Styling:** To apply styles like colors, fonts, backgrounds, borders, spacing, and other visual effects to HTML elements.
3.  **Layout Control:** To manage the layout of web pages, positioning elements precisely using techniques like Flexbox, Grid, floats, and positioning schemes.
4.  **Responsiveness:** To adapt the layout and appearance of a website to different screen sizes and devices (e.g., desktops, tablets, mobile phones) using Media Queries.
5.  **Efficiency and Consistency:** To apply consistent styles across multiple pages or an entire website by linking a single external CSS file, saving time and ensuring a uniform look.
6.  **Accessibility:** To improve accessibility by providing flexible styling options that can be adapted for users with different needs.

## CSS Syntax

A CSS rule consists of two main parts: a **selector** and one or more **declarations**.

```css
selector {
  property: value; /* Declaration 1 */
  property: value; /* Declaration 2 */
  /* ... more declarations ... */
}
```

  * **Selector:** Points to the HTML element(s) you want to style (e.g., `h1`, `p`, `.my-class`, `#my-id`).
  * **Declarations:** Contained within curly braces `{}`. Each declaration includes:
      * **Property:** The style attribute you want to change (e.g., `color`, `font-size`, `margin`).
      * **Value:** The value for the given property (e.g., `blue`, `16px`, `20px`).
      * Each property-value pair is separated by a colon `:` and each declaration is terminated by a semicolon `;`.

### Example of a CSS Rule:

```css
p {
  color: #333; /* Sets text color to dark gray */
  font-family: Arial, sans-serif; /* Sets font */
  font-size: 16px; /* Sets font size */
  line-height: 1.5; /* Sets line spacing */
}
```

## How to Include CSS in HTML

There are three ways to insert CSS into an HTML document:

1.  **External Stylesheets (Recommended):**

      * CSS code is written in a separate `.css` file.
      * Linked in the HTML `<head>` section using the `<link>` tag.
      * **Advantages:** Best for maintainability, caching, and separation of concerns.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```html
    <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">
    </head>
    ```

    ```css
    /* In your CSS file (e.g., styles.css) */
    body {
        font-family: sans-serif;
    }
    h1 {
        color: navy;
    }
    ```

2.  **Internal Stylesheets:**

      * CSS code is written directly within the HTML document, inside a `<style>` tag in the `<head>` section.
      * **Advantages:** Useful for single pages or when styles are unique to that page.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```html
    <head>
        <style>
            h1 {
                color: green;
                font-size: 24px;
            }
            p {
                margin-left: 20px;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    ```

3.  **Inline Styles:**

      * CSS code is applied directly to a specific HTML element using the `style` attribute.
      * **Advantages:** Quick for minor, element-specific overrides.
      * **Disadvantages:** Generally discouraged for complex styling as it mixes content with presentation, makes maintenance difficult, and cannot be reused.

    <!-- end list -->

    ```html
    <p style="color: purple; font-weight: bold;">This paragraph has inline styles.</p>
    ```

# All CSS "Tags" (Selectors & Properties)

In CSS, we don't have "tags" in the HTML sense. Instead, we have **selectors** (which target HTML elements) and **properties** (which define style characteristics).

## 1\. CSS Selectors

Selectors are patterns used to select the HTML elements you want to style.

| Selector Type | Example | Description |
| :------------ | :------ | :---------- |
| **Element/Type** | `p { ... }` | Selects all HTML elements of a given type. |
| **Class** | `.highlight { ... }` | Selects elements with a specific `class` attribute. |
| **ID** | `#main-header { ... }` | Selects a single element with a specific `id` attribute. (IDs should be unique per page). |
| **Universal** | `* { ... }` | Selects all elements on the page. |
| **Attribute** | `a[target="_blank"] { ... }` | Selects elements with a specific attribute or attribute value. |
| **Descendant** | `div p { ... }` | Selects all `<p>` elements that are descendants of a `<div>` element. |
| **Child** | `ul > li { ... }` | Selects all `<li>` elements that are direct children of a `<ul>` element. |
| **Adjacent Sibling** | `h1 + p { ... }` | Selects the first `<p>` element immediately preceded by an `<h1>` element. |
| **General Sibling** | `h1 ~ p { ... }` | Selects all `<p>` elements that are siblings of an `<h1>` element and appear after it. |
| **Pseudo-class** | `:hover`, `:focus`, `:first-child` | Selects elements based on their state or position (e.g., when hovered over, when focused, or the first child of their parent). |
| **Pseudo-element** | `::before`, `::after`, `::first-line` | Selects and styles a specific part of an element (e.g., inserting content before or after an element's content, or styling the first line of text). |

# 500 CSS Questions & Answers

This section provides a comprehensive list of 500 questions and answers covering various CSS topics.

-----

## Part 1: CSS Fundamentals & Syntax (Q1-Q50)

**Q1:** What does CSS stand for?
**A1:** Cascading Style Sheets.

**Q2:** What is the primary purpose of CSS?
**A2:** To describe the presentation (look and formatting) of a document written in HTML.

**Q3:** How do you apply CSS to an HTML document? Name three ways.
**A3:** External stylesheets, internal stylesheets, and inline styles.

**Q4:** What is an external stylesheet, and how is it linked to HTML?
**A4:** A `.css` file containing CSS rules. Linked using `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">` in the HTML `<head>`.

**Q5:** What are the advantages of using external stylesheets?
**A5:** Separation of concerns, easier maintenance, faster page loads (due to browser caching), consistency across multiple pages.

**Q6:** What is an internal stylesheet, and where is it placed?
**A6:** CSS rules written within `<style>` tags in the `<head>` section of an HTML document.

**Q7:** When would you use an internal stylesheet?
**A7:** For single HTML pages, or when styles are unique to that specific page and not reused elsewhere.

**Q8:** What are inline styles, and how are they applied?
**A8:** CSS rules applied directly to an HTML element using the `style` attribute (e.g., `<p style="color: blue;">`).

**Q9:** When are inline styles typically used?
**A9:** For very specific, element-level overrides or for quick testing, but generally discouraged for complex styling.

**Q10:** What is a CSS rule set composed of?
**A10:** A selector and one or more declarations.

**Q11:** What is a CSS selector?
**A11:** A pattern used to select the HTML elements you want to style.

**Q12:** What is a CSS declaration?
**A12:** A property-value pair within a CSS rule set, enclosed in curly braces.

**Q13:** What is a CSS property?
**A13:** A style attribute you want to change (e.g., `color`, `font-size`).

**Q14:** What is a CSS value?
**A14:** The specific setting for a given property (e.g., `blue`, `16px`).

**Q15:** How do you write a comment in CSS?
**A15:** Comments are enclosed in `/*` and `*/`.
` css /* This is a single-line comment */ /* This is a multi-line comment */  `

**Q16:** What is the difference between an element selector and a class selector?
**A16:**

  * **Element Selector:** Targets all instances of a specific HTML tag (e.g., `p { ... }` targets all paragraphs).
  * **Class Selector:** Targets elements that have a specific `class` attribute, prefixed with a dot (e.g., `.my-class { ... }` targets `<div class="my-class">`).

**Q17:** What is an ID selector, and how is it used?
**A17:** An ID selector targets a single element with a specific `id` attribute, prefixed with a hash (`#`). IDs must be unique per page (e.g., `#header { ... }` targets `<div id="header">`).

**Q18:** What is the universal selector, and what does it select?
**A18:** The universal selector is `*`. It selects all elements on a page.
` css * { margin: 0; padding: 0; }  `

**Q19:** What is specificity in CSS?
**A19:** Specificity is the algorithm that determines which CSS rule applies to an element when multiple rules conflict. It's calculated based on the types of selectors used.

**Q20:** List the order of specificity from lowest to highest.
**A20:**

1.  Universal selector (`*`)
2.  Element selectors (`p`, `div`)
3.  Class selectors (`.class`), attribute selectors (`[type="text"]`), pseudo-classes (`:hover`)
4.  ID selectors (`#id`)
5.  Inline styles (`style=""`)
6.  `!important` (overrides all but other `!important` rules)

**Q21:** How does `!important` affect specificity? Is it good practice to use it often?
**A21:** `!important` overrides almost all other declarations, regardless of specificity. It's generally **not** good practice to use it often, as it makes CSS difficult to maintain, debug, and override. It breaks the natural cascade.

**Q22:** What is the CSS Box Model?
**A22:** The CSS Box Model describes how elements are rendered as rectangular boxes, consisting of a content area, padding, borders, and margins.

**Q23:** Name the four main components of the Box Model.
**A23:** Content, Padding, Border, Margin.

**Q24:** What is the `content` area of the Box Model?
**A24:** The innermost area, where the actual text, images, or other media of the element resides. Its dimensions are set by `width` and `height`.

**Q25:** What is `padding` in the Box Model?
**A25:** The space between the content area and the border. It pushes the border outwards and takes the background color of the element.

**Q26:** What is `border` in the Box Model?
**A26:** A line that goes around the padding and content. It has `width`, `style`, and `color` properties.

**Q27:** What is `margin` in the Box Model?
**A27:** The transparent space outside the border. It creates space between the element and other adjacent elements.

**Q28:** How do you set individual sides for `margin` or `padding`?
**A28:** Using `margin-top`, `margin-right`, `margin-bottom`, `margin-left` (and similarly for `padding`).

**Q29:** Explain the `margin` shorthand property for four values.
**A29:** `margin: top right bottom left;`
` css margin: 10px 20px 30px 40px; /* Top 10px, Right 20px, Bottom 30px, Left 40px */  `

**Q30:** Explain the `margin` shorthand property for two values.
**A30:** `margin: vertical horizontal;`
` css margin: 10px 20px; /* Top/Bottom 10px, Left/Right 20px */  `

**Q31:** What is `border-radius` used for?
**A31:** To create rounded corners for an element's box.
` css border-radius: 8px;  `

**Q32:** What does `box-sizing: border-box;` do? Why is it useful?
**A32:** It changes the Box Model calculation so that an element's `width` and `height` properties include its `padding` and `border`. It's useful because it makes element sizing more intuitive and predictable, especially in responsive layouts.

**Q33:** What is `box-sizing: content-box;`?
**A33:** The default Box Model, where `width` and `height` apply only to the content area, and padding and border are added *on top* of those dimensions.

**Q34:** How do you set the background color of an element?
**A34:** Using the `background-color` property.
` css background-color: #f0f0f0;  `

**Q35:** How do you add a background image to an element?
**A35:** Using the `background-image` property.
` css background-image: url('images/bg.png');  `

**Q36:** How do you prevent a background image from repeating?
**A36:** Using `background-repeat: no-repeat;`
` css background-repeat: no-repeat;  `

**Q37:** How do you position a background image?
**A37:** Using `background-position` (e.g., `center`, `top left`, `50% 50%`).
` css background-position: center top;  `

**Q38:** What is the `background-size` property for? Name two common values.
**A38:** It specifies the size of the background image.

  * `cover`: Scales the image to cover the entire container, potentially cropping parts.
  * `contain`: Scales the image to fit within the container, preserving aspect ratio.

**Q39:** What is the `background-attachment` property for?
**A39:** It determines whether a background image scrolls with the rest of the page or remains fixed in the viewport.

  * `scroll` (default): Scrolls with the page.
  * `fixed`: Remains fixed relative to the viewport.
  * `local`: Scrolls with the element's content if it has a scroll mechanism.

**Q40:** How do you set multiple background images on an element?
**A40:** Separate the `url()` values with commas in the `background-image` property.
` css background-image: url('image1.png'), url('image2.png');  `

**Q41:** What is the `background` shorthand property? Provide an example.
**A41:** A shorthand for `background-color`, `background-image`, `background-repeat`, `background-attachment`, `background-position`, and `background-size`.
` css background: #f0f0f0 url('bg.png') no-repeat center / cover fixed;  `

**Q42:** What are the common units for lengths in CSS?
**A42:** `px` (pixels), `%` (percentage), `em`, `rem`, `vw` (viewport width), `vh` (viewport height).

**Q43:** What is the difference between `px` and `em` units?
**A43:**

  * `px` (pixels): An absolute unit, always the same size regardless of other factors.
  * `em`: A relative unit, relative to the `font-size` of its **parent** element. (e.g., if parent is 16px, 1em = 16px; if child is 2em, it's 32px).

**Q44:** What is the `rem` unit, and why is it often preferred over `em` for font sizes?
**A44:** `rem` (root em) is a relative unit, relative to the `font-size` of the **root HTML element** (`<html>`). It's preferred because it prevents the compounding sizing issues that can occur with `em` in deeply nested elements, making scaling more predictable and easier for responsive design.

**Q45:** What are `vw` and `vh` units?
**A45:**

  * `vw` (viewport width): Relative to 1% of the viewport's width.
  * `vh` (viewport height): Relative to 1% of the viewport's height.
    Useful for creating elements that scale directly with the browser window size.

**Q46:** How do you define colors in CSS? Name common formats.
**A46:**

  * **Named Colors:** `red`, `blue`, `green`
  * **Hexadecimal:** `#RRGGBB` (e.g., `#FF0000` for red), `#RGB` (e.g., `#F00`)
  * **RGB:** `rgb(red, green, blue)` (e.g., `rgb(255, 0, 0)`)
  * **RGBA:** `rgba(red, green, blue, alpha)` (e.g., `rgba(255, 0, 0, 0.5)` for semi-transparent red)
  * **HSL:** `hsl(hue, saturation, lightness)` (e.g., `hsl(0, 100%, 50%)` for red)
  * **HSLA:** `hsla(hue, saturation, lightness, alpha)` (e.g., `hsla(0, 100%, 50%, 0.5)`)

**Q47:** What is the `opacity` property used for?
**A47:** To set the transparency level of an entire element (including its content and children). Values range from `0` (fully transparent) to `1` (fully opaque).

**Q48:** What is the difference between `opacity` and `rgba()` for transparency?
**A48:**

  * `opacity`: Makes the entire element, including its content and children, transparent.
  * `rgba()`: Only makes the *color* value (e.g., background or text color) transparent, while the content of the element remains opaque.

**Q49:** What does the C in CSS stand for? Explain "Cascading."
**A49:** C stands for "Cascading." "Cascading" refers to the specific order in which CSS rules are applied when multiple rules could apply to the same element. It's a hierarchical system that determines which style wins based on importance, specificity, and source order.

**Q50:** How does the "cascade" principle work with conflicting styles?
**A50:** When conflicting styles are present, CSS resolves them in this order:

1.  **Importance:** `!important` rules override normal rules.
2.  **Origin:** Author styles (your CSS) \> User styles \> Browser default styles.
3.  **Specificity:** More specific selectors override less specific ones.
4.  **Order of Appearance:** If specificity is equal, the last declared rule wins.

-----

## Part 2: Selectors & Specificity (Q51-Q100)

**Q51:** Explain the descendant selector. Provide an example.
**A51:** Selects elements that are descendants (anywhere nested inside) of another specified element. Uses a space.
` css div p { color: blue; /* Selects all <p> inside any <div> */ }  `

**Q52:** Explain the child selector. Provide an example.
**A52:** Selects elements that are direct children of a specified element. Uses `>`.
` css ul > li { border: 1px solid gray; /* Selects only direct <li> children of <ul> */ }  `

**Q53:** What is the difference between a descendant selector and a child selector?
**A53:** A descendant selector targets elements *anywhere* nested inside the parent. A child selector targets elements *only if they are direct immediate children* of the parent.

**Q54:** Explain the adjacent sibling selector. Provide an example.
**A54:** Selects an element that is immediately preceded by a specified element. Uses `+`.
` css h1 + p { margin-top: 0; /* Selects the first <p> immediately after an <h1> */ }  `

**Q55:** Explain the general sibling selector. Provide an example.
**A55:** Selects all elements that are siblings of a specified element and appear after it. Uses `~`.
` css h2 ~ p { text-indent: 20px; /* Selects all <p> elements that are siblings of an <h2> and come after it */ }  `

**Q56:** What is an attribute selector? Provide an example.
**A56:** Selects elements based on the presence or value of an attribute.
` css a[target="_blank"] { color: orange; /* Selects <a> tags with target="_blank" */ } input[type="submit"] { background-color: green; /* Selects <input> tags with type="submit" */ }  `

**Q57:** How do you select elements whose attribute value *contains* a specific substring?
**A57:** Using `*=` (wildcard attribute selector).
` css [class*="button"] { /* Selects elements with class="my-button" or class="large-button" */ padding: 10px; }  `

**Q58:** How do you select elements whose attribute value *begins with* a specific substring?
**A58:** Using `^=` (starts with attribute selector).
` css [href^="https://"] { /* Selects <a> tags whose href starts with "https://" */ border-bottom: 1px solid blue; }  `

**Q59:** How do you select elements whose attribute value *ends with* a specific substring?
**A59:** Using `$=` (ends with attribute selector).
` css [src$=".png"] { /* Selects images whose src ends with ".png" */ border: 2px solid lightblue; }  `

**Q60:** How do you select elements whose attribute value contains a specific word *in a space-separated list*?
**A60:** Using `~=` (includes word attribute selector).
` css [class~="active"] { /* Selects elements whose class attribute list contains "active" (e.g. class="item active selected") */ font-weight: bold; }  `

**Q61:** What are pseudo-classes? Provide an example.
**A61:** Pseudo-classes select elements based on their state (e.g., `:hover`, `:focus`, `:active`), their position within the document tree (e.g., `:first-child`, `:nth-child`), or other characteristics not expressed in the markup.
` css a:hover { text-decoration: underline; /* Styles link when mouse hovers over it */ }  `

**Q62:** Explain `:nth-child(n)` and `:nth-of-type(n)`.
**A62:**

  * `:nth-child(n)`: Selects an element that is the `n`-th child of its parent, *regardless of its type*.
  * `:nth-of-type(n)`: Selects an element that is the `n`-th child of its parent, *but only considering elements of the same type*.

**Q63:** How do you select the first child of an element?
**A63:** Using `:first-child`.
` css li:first-child { font-weight: bold; }  `

**Q64:** How do you select the last child of an element?
**A64:** Using `:last-child`.
` css li:last-child { color: red; }  `

**Q65:** How do you select odd or even children using pseudo-classes?
**A65:** Using `2n` or `odd` for odd, and `2n+1` or `even` for even.
` css tr:nth-child(odd) { background-color: #f9f9f9; } li:nth-child(even) { color: gray; }  `

**Q66:** What are pseudo-elements? Provide an example.
**A66:** Pseudo-elements select and style a specific part of an element's content. They are prefixed with `::`.
` css p::first-line { font-weight: bold; /* Styles the first line of every paragraph */ }  `

**Q67:** Explain `::before` and `::after`. What property is mandatory for them to work?
**A67:**

  * `::before`: Inserts generated content *before* the content of the selected element.
  * `::after`: Inserts generated content *after* the content of the selected element.
  * The `content` property is mandatory for `::before` and `::after` to render anything.
    ```css
    a::after {
      content: " (External Link)";
      font-size: 0.8em;
    }
    ```

**Q68:** What is the difference between single colon (`:`) and double colon (`::`) for pseudo-elements?
**A68:** Single colon (`:`) is the legacy syntax from CSS2.1 for pseudo-elements (e.g., `:first-line`). Double colon (`::`) is the newer, recommended syntax from CSS3 to distinguish pseudo-classes from pseudo-elements. Most browsers support both for older pseudo-elements.

**Q69:** How do you select an element that is *not* a specific type or doesn't have a specific class?
**A69:** Using the `:not()` negation pseudo-class.
` css p:not(.intro) { /* Selects all <p> elements that do NOT have the class "intro" */ text-align: justify; }  `

**Q70:** What is `initial` as a CSS value?
**A70:** `initial` resets a property to its initial (default) value, as defined by the CSS specification (not necessarily the browser's default stylesheet).

**Q71:** What is `inherit` as a CSS value?
**A71:** `inherit` makes a property's value the same as the computed value of that property on the parent element.

**Q72:** What is CSS inheritance?
**A72:** Inheritance is a mechanism where some CSS properties (e.g., `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `line-height`, `text-align`) are automatically passed down from a parent element to its child elements if not explicitly overridden.

**Q73:** Name two properties that typically inherit and two that do not.
**A73:**

  * **Inherit:** `color`, `font-family`, `font-size`, `text-align`, `line-height`.
  * **Do Not Inherit:** `margin`, `padding`, `border`, `width`, `height`, `background-color`.

**Q74:** How can you force a property to inherit even if it doesn't by default?
**A74:** By explicitly setting its value to `inherit`.
` css .child-div { border: inherit; /* If parent has a border, child will inherit it */ }  `

**Q75:** What is the purpose of `reset.css` or `normalize.css`?
**A75:** Both aim to provide a more consistent baseline for styling across different browsers by addressing browser inconsistencies in default styles.

  * **Reset.css:** Strips away all default browser styles, requiring more custom styling but providing a clean slate.
  * **Normalize.css:** Preserves useful browser defaults while normalizing inconsistencies, requiring less custom styling.

**Q76:** Explain grouping selectors. Provide an example.
**A76:** Grouping selectors allows you to apply the same styles to multiple elements by separating them with commas.
` css h1, h2, h3 { font-family: 'Open Sans', sans-serif; color: #333; }  `

**Q77:** What is a contextual selector?
**A77:** A selector that applies styles based on an element's context or relationship to other elements (e.g., `nav a` for links inside navigation, `ul li:first-child`).

**Q78:** How do you select an element that is currently being hovered over?
**A78:** Using the `:hover` pseudo-class.
` css button:hover { background-color: lightblue; }  `

**Q79:** How do you select an element that is currently focused (e.g., an input field)?
**A79:** Using the `:focus` pseudo-class.
` css input:focus { border-color: blue; box-shadow: 0 0 5px rgba(0, 0, 255, 0.5); }  `

**Q80:** What is `:active` pseudo-class used for?
**A80:** It selects an element that is being activated by the user (e.g., when a button is being clicked down).

**Q81:** How do you style visited links?
**A81:** Using the `:visited` pseudo-class.
` css a:visited { color: purple; }  `

**Q82:** How do you style elements that are currently checked (e.g., checkboxes, radio buttons)?
**A82:** Using the `:checked` pseudo-class.
` css input[type="checkbox"]:checked + label { font-weight: bold; }  `

**Q83:** What is `:empty` pseudo-class?
**A83:** Selects elements that have no children (not even text nodes or whitespace).
` css div:empty { display: none; }  `

**Q84:** What is `:target` pseudo-class?
**A84:** Selects the element that is the target of the current URL's fragment identifier (e.g., if URL is `page.html#section1`, then `#section1` element is targeted).

**Q85:** What is `:root` pseudo-class?
**A85:** Represents the `<html>` element. It has higher specificity than the `html` element selector and is often used for defining CSS variables.
` css :root { --primary-color: blue; }  `

**Q86:** What is `:focus-visible` pseudo-class and why is it important for accessibility?
**A86:** `:focus-visible` selects an element when it is focused *and* the browser determines that the focus *should be visibly indicated* to the user (e.g., when tabbing with a keyboard, but not necessarily when clicking with a mouse). It helps improve accessibility by only showing the focus outline when it's most useful.

**Q87:** How do you select the first line of a paragraph?
**A87:** Using `::first-line`.
` css p::first-line { font-variant: small-caps; }  `

**Q88:** How do you select the first letter of a paragraph?
**A88:** Using `::first-letter`.
` css p::first-letter { font-size: 200%; color: #888; }  `

**Q89:** What is the `::selection` pseudo-element?
**A89:** It styles the portion of an element that is highlighted by the user (e.g., when text is selected with the mouse).
` css ::selection { background-color: yellow; color: black; }  `

**Q90:** How would you style every third list item in an unordered list?
**A90:** Using `:nth-child(3n)`.
` css ul li:nth-child(3n) { background-color: lightgreen; }  `

**Q91:** How would you style the paragraph that is the second child of its parent, but *only if* it is a paragraph?
**A91:** Using `p:nth-of-type(2)`.

**Q92:** What is `[attribute="value"]` vs `[attribute]` selectors?
**A92:**

  * `[attribute="value"]`: Selects elements where the attribute has an *exact* specified value.
  * `[attribute]`: Selects elements that simply *have* the specified attribute, regardless of its value.

**Q93:** What is `counter-reset` and `counter-increment` properties?
**A93:** Used for creating custom counters in CSS, often in conjunction with `::before` or `::after` to display numbered content that is not part of the HTML markup.

  * `counter-reset`: Initializes or resets a counter.
  * `counter-increment`: Increments a counter.

**Q94:** Explain the `:enabled` and `:disabled` pseudo-classes.
**A94:**

  * `:enabled`: Selects user interface elements (like `<input>`, `<button>`) that are currently enabled.
  * `:disabled`: Selects user interface elements that are currently disabled.

**Q95:** What is the `:read-only` pseudo-class?
**A95:** Selects an input element that is read-only (has the `readonly` attribute set).

**Q96:** What is the `:read-write` pseudo-class?
**A96:** Selects an input element that is user-editable (does not have the `readonly` or `disabled` attribute set).

**Q97:** How do you combine selectors to target a very specific element? Provide an example.
**A97:** By chaining selectors.
` css div.container > p.intro:first-child { font-size: 1.2em; font-weight: bold; } /* Selects the first paragraph with class "intro" that is a direct child of a div with class "container" */  `

**Q98:** What is the impact of using `*` (universal selector) frequently?
**A98:** It can lead to performance issues as the browser has to check every element. It also has low specificity, making it easily overridden. Use it sparingly, typically for global resets.

**Q99:** How can you increase the specificity of a selector without adding more HTML structure?
**A99:** By:

  * Adding more specific selectors (e.g., `div.my-class` instead of `.my-class`).
  * Using ID selectors (`#my-id`).
  * Repeating a simple selector (e.g., `p.my-class.my-class`).
  * Using `:not()` (it adds specificity equal to the selector inside, but doesn't apply the style if it matches).
  * Using `:is()` or `:where()` (careful, `:is()` adds the highest specificity of its arguments, `:where()` adds zero specificity).

**Q100:** When would you use a more specific selector versus a less specific one?
**A100:**

  * **More Specific:** When you need to override styles from broader rules, or target a unique element that has no ID.
  * **Less Specific:** For general styling that should apply widely and be easily overridden (e.g., base font styles on `body`, or common button styles with classes).

## Part 3: Typography & Text (Q101-Q150)

**Q101:** How do you set the font family for text?
**A101:** Using `font-family`.
` css font-family: Arial, sans-serif;  `

**Q102:** What is a "fallback font" in `font-family`? Why is it important?
**A102:** A fallback font is a generic font family (e.g., `sans-serif`, `serif`, `monospace`) specified after a specific font name. It's important because if the user's system doesn't have the primary font, the browser can use the fallback, ensuring readability.

**Q103:** How do you set the font size?
**A103:** Using `font-size` (e.g., `16px`, `1em`, `1.2rem`).

**Q104:** How do you set the font weight (boldness)?
**A104:** Using `font-weight` (e.g., `normal`, `bold`, `lighter`, `bolder`, or numerical values `100` to `900`).

**Q105:** How do you set the font style (italic, normal)?
**A105:** Using `font-style` (`normal`, `italic`, `oblique`).

**Q106:** What is the `font` shorthand property? Provide an example.
**A106:** A shorthand for `font-style`, `font-variant`, `font-weight`, `font-size`, `line-height`, and `font-family`.
` css font: italic bold 1.2em/1.5 Arial, sans-serif; /* font-style font-weight font-size/line-height font-family */  `

**Q107:** How do you set the color of text?
**A107:** Using the `color` property.
` css color: #333;  `

**Q108:** How do you align text horizontally?
**A108:** Using `text-align` (`left`, `right`, `center`, `justify`).
` css text-align: center;  `

**Q109:** What is `text-decoration` used for? Name common values.
**A109:** To apply or remove text decorations.

  * `none`: Removes any decoration (common for links).
  * `underline`: Underlines text.
  * `overline`: Puts a line over text.
  * `line-through`: Puts a line through text.

**Q110:** How do you change text to uppercase, lowercase, or capitalize each word?
**A110:** Using `text-transform`.

  * `uppercase`
  * `lowercase`
  * `capitalize`
    ```css
    text-transform: uppercase;
    ```

**Q111:** What is `letter-spacing` used for?
**A111:** To control the space between characters (letters).
` css letter-spacing: 0.5px;  `

**Q112:** What is `word-spacing` used for?
**A112:** To control the space between words.
` css word-spacing: 5px;  `

**Q113:** What is `line-height` used for? Why is it important for readability?
**A113:** It sets the height of each line of text, controlling the vertical spacing between lines. It's crucial for readability; too small and lines merge, too large and text looks disconnected.

**Q114:** What is the difference between `line-height: 1.5;` and `line-height: 1.5em;`?
**A114:**

  * `line-height: 1.5;` (unitless): The recommended approach. It's a factor of the element's own font size, meaning child elements will inherit this *factor*, ensuring consistent scaling.
  * `line-height: 1.5em;`: The line height is 1.5 times the *parent's* font size. Child elements will inherit this *computed value*, which can lead to scaling issues if the child's font size changes.

**Q115:** What is `white-space` used for? Name common values.
**A115:** It controls how whitespace inside an element is handled.

  * `normal`: Collapses multiple whitespace characters into a single space, wraps text as needed.
  * `nowrap`: Collapses whitespace, but prevents text from wrapping onto a new line.
  * `pre`: Preserves whitespace and line breaks (like `<pre>` HTML tag).
  * `pre-wrap`: Preserves whitespace and line breaks, but wraps text as needed.
  * `pre-line`: Collapses whitespace, but preserves line breaks.

**Q116:** How do you add a text shadow? Provide an example.
**A116:** Using `text-shadow`.
` css text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px #ccc; /* horizontal-offset vertical-offset blur-radius color */  `

**Q117:** How do you indent the first line of text in a paragraph?
**A117:** Using `text-indent`.
` css text-indent: 50px;  `

**Q118:** What is `text-overflow` used for? What other properties are often used with it?
**A118:** It determines how overflowed content (content that exceeds its container's width) is signaled to the user. Often used with `white-space: nowrap;` and `overflow: hidden;`.

  * `ellipsis`: Displays an ellipsis (...) to indicate truncated text.
  * `clip`: Truncates text.

**Q119:** Provide an example of `text-overflow: ellipsis;`.
**A119:**
` css .single-line-ellipsis { white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; }  `

**Q120:** What is `word-break` used for? Name common values.
**A120:** Specifies how words should break when reaching the end of a line.

  * `normal`: Default breaking rules.
  * `break-all`: Words can break at any character to prevent overflow.
  * `keep-all`: Only breaks at spaces. (Useful for CJK languages).

**Q121:** What is `overflow-wrap` (formerly `word-wrap`)?
**A121:** Specifies whether the browser should break otherwise unbreakable strings (like long URLs) to prevent overflow.

  * `normal`: Only break words at allowed break points.
  * `anywhere`: Breaks anywhere, even in the middle of a word.
  * `break-word`: Breaks words at arbitrary points to prevent overflow.

**Q122:** How do you force text to hyphenate automatically?
**A122:** Using `hyphens: auto;` (requires `lang` attribute on HTML and `word-break` or `overflow-wrap` properties).

**Q123:** What is `vertical-align` used for? Which types of elements does it affect?
**A123:** It's used to set the vertical alignment of **inline-level and table-cell elements**. It aligns content relative to the line box or its parent. It does *not* work on block-level elements.

**Q124:** What is `font-variant`?
**A124:** `font-variant` allows you to render text in small caps (where lowercase letters are rendered as uppercase but at a smaller size).
` css font-variant: small-caps;  `

**Q125:** How do you embed custom fonts in CSS?
**A125:** Using the `@font-face` rule.
` css @font-face { font-family: 'MyCustomFont'; src: url('fonts/mycustomfont.woff2') format('woff2'), url('fonts/mycustomfont.woff') format('woff'); font-weight: normal; font-style: normal; } body { font-family: 'MyCustomFont', sans-serif; }  `

**Q126:** What are common font formats for web fonts?
**A126:** `WOFF2` (Web Open Font Format 2.0 - best compression and quality), `WOFF` (Web Open Font Format), `EOT` (Embedded OpenType - for older IE), `TTF` (TrueType Font), `OTF` (OpenType Font), `SVG` (SVG Font - for older iOS).

**Q127:** What is `font-display` in `@font-face`?
**A127:** `font-display` determines how a font face is displayed based on whether and when it is downloaded and ready to use. Common values include `auto`, `block`, `swap`, `fallback`, and `optional`. `swap` is often used for performance.

**Q128:** What does `font-display: swap;` do?
**A128:** Gives the font face a zero second block period and an infinite swap period. This means the browser immediately uses a fallback font while the custom font is loading, and "swaps" to the custom font once it's available. This prevents "invisible text" (FOIT).

**Q129:** How do you adjust the opacity of text without affecting its background?
**A129:** By using `rgba()` or `hsla()` for the `color` property, or by setting `opacity` on the element that *only* contains the text and not its background.

**Q130:** What is `text-shadow` used for? Provide an example.
**A130:** To apply shadow effects to text.
` css text-shadow: 2px 2px 4px rgba(0,0,0,0.5);  `

**Q131:** What is `font-stretch`?
**A131:** `font-stretch` controls how condensed or expanded a font is. It only works if the font family has different stretched variants available.

**Q132:** How do you use the `initial` keyword with font properties?
**A132:** Setting `font-size: initial;` will revert the font size to the browser's default for that element (e.g., 16px for `<p>`, larger for `<h1>`).

**Q133:** How do you use the `unset` keyword?
**A133:** `unset` behaves like `inherit` if the property is normally inherited, and like `initial` if the property is not normally inherited. It's a useful reset.

**Q134:** What is `line-break`?
**A134:** `line-break` specifies how to break lines, particularly for CJK (Chinese, Japanese, Korean) characters.

**Q135:** What is `hyphens`?
**A135:** Controls hyphenation of words across lines. Requires language settings and often browser-specific support.

**Q136:** How do you prevent text from wrapping and instead truncate it with an ellipsis?
**A136:**
` css .truncate-text { white-space: nowrap; overflow: hidden; text-overflow: ellipsis; }  `

**Q137:** What is `font-feature-settings`?
**A137:** Allows low-level control over OpenType font features (e.g., ligatures, alternate glyphs).
` css font-feature-settings: "liga" 0, "clig" 0; /* Disables standard ligatures */  `

**Q138:** What is `font-kerning`?
**A138:** Controls the use of kerning tables stored in the font. Kerning adjusts the spacing between specific pairs of characters to improve visual appearance.

**Q139:** What is `font-synthesis`?
**A139:** Controls whether the browser should synthesize (fake) bold, italic, or small-caps font faces when true font files aren't available for those styles.

**Q140:** Explain the `ch` unit. When is it useful?
**A140:** The `ch` unit represents the "advance measure" (width) of the "0" (zero) character of the element's font. It's useful for setting widths for text blocks to ensure a consistent number of characters per line, regardless of font size, which aids readability.

**Q141:** Explain the `ex` unit.
**A141:** The `ex` unit represents the x-height of the element's font, which is typically the height of a lowercase 'x'. It's also a relative font-based unit.

**Q142:** How can you force a break (like `<br>`) within a `::before` or `::after` generated content?
**A142:** You can use the `\A` (newline) character in the `content` property, along with `white-space: pre;` or `white-space: pre-wrap;` on the element or pseudo-element itself.
` css .item::before { content: "New Line:\A"; white-space: pre; }  `

**Q143:** What is `text-align-last`?
**A143:** Specifies how the last line of a block or a line right before a forced line break should be aligned.

**Q144:** How do you set a custom list marker with `::marker`?
**A144:** The `::marker` pseudo-element allows styling the default list marker (bullet or number).
` css li::marker { color: red; font-size: 1.2em; }  `

**Q145:** What is `text-rendering`?
**A145:** `text-rendering` is a CSS property that provides information to the rendering engine about how to optimize when rendering text. Values like `optimizeLegibility` or `geometricPrecision` can prioritize legibility or speed.

**Q146:** What is `font-variant-numeric`?
**A146:** Controls the usage of numerical alternates, fractions, and ordinal markers, useful for fine-tuning number presentation.

**Q147:** How do you create small caps using `font-feature-settings`?
**A147:**
` css font-feature-settings: "smcp"; /* Enables small caps */  `

**Q148:** What is `writing-mode` and what is its purpose?
**A148:** `writing-mode` sets whether lines of text are laid out horizontally or vertically, and the direction in which blocks progress. Useful for internationalization (e.g., for Japanese vertical text).
` css writing-mode: vertical-lr; /* Vertical text, flows left to right */  `

**Q149:** What is `direction` property?
**A149:** `direction` sets the direction of text, table columns, and horizontal overflow. Common values are `ltr` (left-to-right, default) and `rtl` (right-to-left, for languages like Arabic, Hebrew).

**Q150:** How do you control the shape of the text cursor within an input field?
**A150:** Using the `caret-color` property.
` css input { caret-color: red; }  `

-----

## Part 4: Layout Fundamentals (Q151-Q200)

**Q151:** What is the `display` property in CSS?
**A151:** The `display` property determines how an element is rendered and how it interacts with other elements on the page (e.g., whether it takes up full width, allows other elements on the same line).

**Q152:** What is the difference between `display: block;` and `display: inline;`?
**A152:**

  * `block`: Takes up the full width available, starts on a new line, and allows setting `width`, `height`, `margin-top`/`bottom`, `padding-top`/`bottom`. Examples: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`.
  * `inline`: Takes up only as much width as necessary, does not start on a new line, and `width`, `height`, `margin-top`/`bottom`, `padding-top`/`bottom` properties have no effect. Examples: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<strong>`.

**Q153:** What is `display: inline-block;`? When is it useful?
**A153:** `inline-block` elements behave like inline elements (don't force a new line) but also allow block-level properties like `width`, `height`, `margin-top`/`bottom`, and `padding-top`/`bottom` to be applied. Useful for creating horizontally aligned elements that can still have dimensions and vertical spacing.

**Q154:** What does `display: none;` do?
**A154:** It completely removes an element from the document flow. It won't take up any space, and its content will not be rendered. It's often used to hide/show elements with JavaScript.

**Q155:** What is the `visibility` property? How does it differ from `display: none;`?
**A155:** The `visibility` property shows or hides an element while preserving its space in the layout.

  * `visibility: hidden;`: Hides the element, but it still occupies its space.
  * `display: none;`: Hides the element and removes it from the document flow; it occupies no space.

**Q156:** What is the `float` property used for? Name its common values.
**A156:** `float` is used to position an element to the left or right, allowing other content to wrap around it. Common values are `left`, `right`, and `none`. Historically used for multi-column layouts, now often replaced by Flexbox or Grid.

**Q157:** What is "clearing floats"? Why is it necessary?
**A157:** Clearing floats means preventing an element from wrapping around a floated element. It's necessary because floated elements are removed from the normal document flow, which can cause their parent containers to collapse or subsequent elements to position incorrectly.

**Q158:** How do you clear floats using the `clear` property?
**A158:** The `clear` property (with values like `left`, `right`, or `both`) is applied to an element that you want to appear *below* the floated elements.
` css .cleared-element { clear: both; /* Clears both left and right floats */ }  `

**Q159:** What is the "clearfix hack"? When is it used?
**A159:** A CSS technique (often using `::after` pseudo-element and `display: table;` or `display: block;` with `clear: both;`) to clear floats without adding extra markup. It's applied to the *parent* container of the floats to prevent it from collapsing.
` css .clearfix::after { content: ""; display: table; clear: both; }  `

**Q160:** What is the `position` property? Name its common values.
**A160:** The `position` property controls how an element is positioned on the page. Common values: `static`, `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`.

**Q161:** Explain `position: static;`
**A161:** The default positioning for all HTML elements. Elements are positioned according to the normal document flow. `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, `z-index` properties have no effect.

**Q162:** Explain `position: relative;`
**A162:** The element is positioned according to the normal flow, then offset relative to its own normal position using `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`. Crucially, it leaves a "gap" in its original space and serves as the positioning context for any `absolute` child elements.

**Q163:** Explain `position: absolute;`
**A163:** The element is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to its nearest positioned ancestor (an ancestor with `position` other than `static`). If no positioned ancestor exists, it's positioned relative to the initial containing block (usually the `<html>` element). It doesn't take up space in the layout.

**Q164:** Explain `position: fixed;`
**A164:** The element is removed from the normal document flow and positioned relative to the browser viewport. It stays in the same place even when the page is scrolled. Useful for sticky headers or footers.

**Q165:** Explain `position: sticky;`
**A165:** The element is positioned relative to its normal position based on the user's scroll position. It behaves like `relative` until a certain scroll threshold, then becomes `fixed` (sticks to the edge of its container or viewport) until its parent container is fully out of view.

**Q166:** What is `z-index`? What conditions must be met for it to work?
**A166:** `z-index` controls the stacking order of positioned elements along the Z-axis (depth). Elements with a higher `z-index` value are stacked in front of elements with a lower value. It only works on elements that have a `position` value other than `static` (i.e., `relative`, `absolute`, `fixed`, or `sticky`).

**Q167:** What is `overflow` property? Name its common values.
**A167:** `overflow` specifies what happens to content that is too large to fit into an element's box.

  * `visible` (default): Content is not clipped and may overflow outside the box.
  * `hidden`: Content is clipped, and the rest is invisible.
  * `scroll`: Content is clipped, and a scrollbar is added to see the rest.
  * `auto`: Adds scrollbars only when necessary.

**Q168:** How do you center a block-level element horizontally?
**A168:** By setting `margin-left: auto;` and `margin-right: auto;` (or `margin: 0 auto;`) and giving it a defined `width`.
` css .center-me { width: 50%; margin: 0 auto; }  `

**Q169:** How do you center an inline element or text horizontally?
**A169:** By applying `text-align: center;` to its block-level parent.
` html <div style="text-align: center;"> <span>Centered Text</span> </div>  `

**Q170:** What is `box-shadow` used for? Provide an example.
**A170:** To apply shadow effects around an element's frame.
` css box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px rgba(0,0,0,0.3); /* offset-x offset-y blur-radius spread-radius color */  `

**Q171:** Can you have multiple `box-shadow`s on one element?
**A171:** Yes, separate them with commas.
` css box-shadow: 2px 2px 5px red, -2px -2px 5px blue;  `

**Q172:** What is `outline` property? How does it differ from `border`?
**A172:** `outline` is a line drawn *outside* the element's border.

  * **Difference:** `outline` does not take up space in the layout (it doesn't affect the box model or layout). `border` does. `outline` is often used for accessibility (e.g., focus indicators).

**Q173:** What is `clip-path`?
**A173:** `clip-path` creates a clipping region for an element, allowing you to reveal only a portion of the element. Shapes can be defined using functions like `circle()`, `polygon()`, `inset()`, or SVG paths.

**Q174:** What is `object-fit` and `object-position`? When are they useful?
**A174:** These properties control how a replaced element (like `<img>` or `<video>`) should be resized to fit its container.

  * `object-fit`:
      * `fill` (default): Fills the box, may stretch/squash.
      * `contain`: Fits within the box, preserving aspect ratio (may leave empty space).
      * `cover`: Fills the box, preserving aspect ratio (may crop).
      * `none`: Original size.
      * `scale-down`: Smallest of `none` or `contain`.
  * `object-position`: Aligns the content within the element's box (like `background-position`).
    Useful for ensuring images/videos fit nicely into predefined layout slots without distortion.

**Q175:** What is the `cursor` property? Provide examples.
**A175:** It defines the mouse cursor to be displayed when hovering over an element.

  * `auto` (default)
  * `pointer` (hand icon, for clickable elements)
  * `text` (I-beam, for text input)
  * `grab`, `grabbing`
  * `not-allowed`
  * `wait`
  * `url()` (custom cursor image)

**Q176:** What is `user-select`?
**A176:** Controls whether the user can select text. Common values: `none` (prevents selection), `auto`, `text`, `all`.

**Q177:** What is `pointer-events`?
**A177:** Determines whether an element will respond to pointer events (mouse clicks, hovers, touches). `pointer-events: none;` makes the element "click-throughable."

**Q178:** How do you set minimum and maximum dimensions for an element?
**A178:** Using `min-width`, `max-width`, `min-height`, `max-height`.

**Q179:** When might `overflow: hidden;` be used beyond clipping content?
**A179:** It can be used as a simple way to clear floats for an element's children (though clearfix is often preferred) or to establish a new block formatting context.

**Q180:** What is the `display: table;` property used for?
**A180:** It makes an element behave like an HTML `<table>` element for layout purposes. It allows the use of `display: table-row;`, `display: table-cell;`, etc., to create table-like layouts without using actual HTML `<table>` tags.

**Q181:** What is the `float` property's behavior when two elements are floated in the same direction?
**A181:** If there's enough horizontal space, they will float next to each other. If not, the second floated element will drop below the first.

**Q182:** How does `position: relative;` enable positioning of its children?
**A182:** When a parent element has `position: relative;` (or `absolute`, `fixed`, `sticky`), it becomes a "positioned ancestor." Any child element with `position: absolute;` will then be positioned relative to this parent, rather than the viewport or `<html>` element.

**Q183:** Can you use `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left` with `position: static;`?
**A183:** No, these offset properties only apply to elements with `position` values other than `static`.

**Q184:** What is "collapsing margins"? How can it be prevented?
**A184:** Collapsing margins occur between adjacent block-level elements where their top and bottom margins merge into a single margin, taking the larger of the two values. It can be prevented by:

  * Using `padding` or `border` between the elements.
  * Establishing a new Block Formatting Context (e.g., using `overflow: hidden;`, `display: flex;`, `display: grid;`, `position: absolute;`).
  * Floating elements.

**Q185:** What is a Block Formatting Context (BFC)? How do you create one?
**A185:** A BFC is a part of a visual CSS rendering where block boxes are laid out. Elements within a BFC do not interact with elements outside it. Creating a BFC:

  * `float` (other than `none`)
  * `position: absolute` or `fixed`
  * `display: inline-block`, `table-cell`, `table-caption`, `flex`, `grid`
  * `overflow` (other than `visible`)
  * `column-span: all`

**Q186:** Why might `overflow: hidden;` be used for parent containers with floated children?
**A186:** It establishes a new Block Formatting Context (BFC) for the parent, which then contains its floated children. This prevents the parent from collapsing its height around its floated children.

**Q187:** What is `visibility: collapse;` primarily used for?
**A187:** Primarily used for table rows, row groups, columns, or column groups to hide them while maintaining the integrity of the table structure. It works similarly to `display: none;` for table elements. For non-table elements, it behaves like `visibility: hidden;`.

**Q188:** How do you remove the default `outline` that appears on focused elements? Is it good practice?
**A188:** Using `outline: none;` or `outline: 0;`. It is **not** good practice to remove it without providing an alternative visual focus indicator, as it negatively impacts keyboard accessibility.

**Q189:** What is `text-indent` for? Can it take negative values?
**A189:** `text-indent` indents the first line of text of a block-level element. Yes, it can take negative values to create a "hanging indent" effect.

**Q190:** What is `word-spacing`?
**A190:** It specifies the spacing between words.

**Q191:** What is the `display: contents;` property?
**A191:** `display: contents;` makes a container element (and its box model) disappear, but its children still render as if they were direct children of the container's parent. Useful for semantic HTML where a wrapper element might interfere with Flexbox or Grid layout.

**Q192:** What are CSS gradients? Name two types.
**A192:** CSS gradients allow you to display smooth transitions between two or more specified colors. They are a type of `background-image`.

  * `linear-gradient()`
  * `radial-gradient()`
  * `conic-gradient()`

**Q193:** Provide a basic example of `linear-gradient`.
**A193:**
` css background-image: linear-gradient(to right, red, yellow);  `

**Q194:** Provide a basic example of `radial-gradient`.
**A194:**
` css background-image: radial-gradient(circle, red, yellow);  `

**Q195:** What is the `cursor: pointer;` property often used for?
**A195:** To visually indicate that an element is clickable, typically by changing the mouse cursor to a hand icon. It's often applied to buttons or custom clickable elements.

**Q196:** What is the `resize` property used for?
**A196:** Allows users to manually resize an element (typically `textarea`). Values: `none`, `both`, `horizontal`, `vertical`.
` css textarea { resize: vertical; }  `

**Q197:** How do you visually hide an element but keep it accessible to screen readers?
**A197:** By using a combination of properties that move it off-screen without using `display: none;` or `visibility: hidden;`. Common techniques include:
` css .sr-only { /* Screen Reader Only */ position: absolute; width: 1px; height: 1px; padding: 0; margin: -1px; overflow: hidden; clip: rect(0, 0, 0, 0); white-space: nowrap; border: 0; }  `

**Q198:** What is the `outline-offset` property?
**A198:** `outline-offset` draws an outline around the element's border, but *outside* the element itself, without taking up space. `outline-offset` specifies the distance between the outline and the border edge.

**Q199:** What is the `appearance` property?
**A199:** The `appearance` property allows an element to be rendered using platform-native styling for user interface controls (e.g., to make a `<div>` look like a native button). `appearance: none;` can remove default browser styling from form elements.

**Q200:** How do you set `min-height` for `<body>` to ensure a footer always stays at the bottom of the viewport even with sparse content?
**A200:**
` css html, body { height: 100%; margin: 0; } body { display: flex; /* Or grid */ flex-direction: column; } main { /* Or main content container */ flex-grow: 1; }  `
This uses Flexbox (or Grid) on the body to make the main content area expand, pushing the footer down.

## Part 5: Flexbox (Q201-Q250)

**Q201:** What is Flexbox?
**A201:** Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout module) is a CSS3 layout module that provides a more efficient way to lay out, align, and distribute space among items in a container, even when their size is unknown or dynamic. It's primarily for one-dimensional layouts (row or column).

**Q202:** How do you enable Flexbox for a container?
**A202:** By setting `display: flex;` or `display: inline-flex;` on the parent element.

**Q203:** What is the difference between a "flex container" and a "flex item"?
**A203:**

  * **Flex Container:** The parent element on which `display: flex;` is applied. It controls the layout of its direct children.
  * **Flex Item:** The direct child elements of a flex container. They are affected by the container's flex properties and can have their own flex properties.

**Q204:** What is the "main axis" in Flexbox?
**A204:** The primary axis along which flex items are laid out. Its direction is determined by `flex-direction`.

**Q205:** What is the "cross axis" in Flexbox?
**A205:** The axis perpendicular to the main axis.

**Q206:** What does `flex-direction` control? Name its values.
**A206:** Controls the direction of the main axis and thus the direction in which flex items are placed.

  * `row` (default): Items arranged horizontally, left to right.
  * `row-reverse`: Items arranged horizontally, right to left.
  * `column`: Items arranged vertically, top to bottom.
  * `column-reverse`: Items arranged vertically, bottom to top.

**Q207:** What does `flex-wrap` control? Name its values.
**A207:** Controls whether flex items should wrap onto multiple lines if they don't fit on a single line.

  * `nowrap` (default): All items stay on one line, potentially overflowing.
  * `wrap`: Items wrap onto multiple lines, from top to bottom.
  * `wrap-reverse`: Items wrap onto multiple lines, from bottom to top.

**Q208:** What is the `flex-flow` shorthand property?
**A208:** A shorthand for `flex-direction` and `flex-wrap`.
` css flex-flow: row wrap; /* Equivalent to flex-direction: row; flex-wrap: wrap; */  `

**Q209:** What does `justify-content` control? Name common values.
**A209:** Aligns flex items along the **main axis**.

  * `flex-start` (default): Items packed to the start of the main axis.
  * `flex-end`: Items packed to the end of the main axis.
  * `center`: Items centered along the main axis.
  * `space-between`: Items distributed evenly with first item at the start, last at the end.
  * `space-around`: Items distributed evenly with space around them (half-size space at ends).
  * `space-evenly`: Items distributed evenly with equal space around them (including ends).

**Q210:** What does `align-items` control? Name common values.
**A210:** Aligns flex items along the **cross axis** within a single line.

  * `stretch` (default): Items stretch to fill the container (respecting min/max-width/height).
  * `flex-start`: Items aligned to the start of the cross axis.
  * `flex-end`: Items aligned to the end of the cross axis.
  * `center`: Items centered along the cross axis.
  * `baseline`: Items aligned based on their baselines.

**Q211:** What does `align-content` control? When is it used?
**A211:** Aligns **flex lines** themselves along the **cross axis** when there is extra space in the cross axis and `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap` or `wrap-reverse`. It doesn't do anything if there's only one flex line. Values similar to `justify-content`.

**Q212:** What is `flex-grow` for flex items?
**A212:** Specifies how much a flex item will grow relative to the rest of the flex items when there is positive free space in the container. Default is `0` (no growth).

**Q213:** What is `flex-shrink` for flex items?
**A213:** Specifies how much a flex item will shrink relative to the rest of the flex items when there is negative free space in the container (i.e., items are overflowing). Default is `1` (can shrink).

**Q214:** What is `flex-basis` for flex items?
**A214:** Defines the initial size of a flex item before any growing or shrinking occurs. Can be a length (`100px`) or a percentage (`50%`), or `auto` (default, content-based size).

**Q215:** What is the `flex` shorthand property for items?
**A215:** A shorthand for `flex-grow`, `flex-shrink`, and `flex-basis`.
` css flex: 1 1 auto; /* Default for most cases */ flex: 1; /* Shorthand for flex: 1 1 0%; */ flex: 0 auto; /* Shorthand for flex: 0 1 auto; */  `

**Q216:** What does `flex: 1;` on a flex item usually mean?
**A216:** `flex: 1;` is a shorthand for `flex: 1 1 0%;`. It means the item will grow to fill available space (`flex-grow: 1`), can shrink (`flex-shrink: 1`), and its initial size is `0%`. This is common for items that should take up equal space.

**Q217:** What does `order` control for flex items?
**A217:** `order` controls the visual order of flex items, regardless of their source order in the HTML. Lower values appear first. Default is `0`.

**Q218:** What does `align-self` control for a flex item?
**A218:** `align-self` allows individual flex items to override the `align-items` property set on the flex container, aligning themselves along the cross axis.

**Q219:** How do you create space between flex items using `gap`?
**A219:** Apply `gap` (or `column-gap`/`row-gap`) to the flex container.
` css .flex-container { display: flex; gap: 20px; /* Applies 20px gap between all flex items */ }  `

**Q220:** What is `display: inline-flex;`?
**A220:** Creates an inline-level flex container, meaning the container itself will behave like an `inline-block` element, but its children will be laid out using Flexbox.

**Q221:** How do you center a single item both horizontally and vertically within a flex container?
**A221:**
` css .flex-container { display: flex; justify-content: center; /* Horizontally */ align-items: center; /* Vertically */ height: 100vh; /* Example: to fill viewport */ }  `

**Q222:** What happens if `flex-wrap` is `nowrap` and flex items overflow?
**A222:** The flex items will overflow the container. The container will not grow to accommodate them, and scrollbars will typically appear if `overflow` is set to `auto` or `scroll` on the container or a parent.

**Q223:** Can you use `margin: auto;` with flex items? What does it do?
**A223:** Yes. `margin: auto;` on a flex item consumes all available free space in that direction, effectively pushing the item as far as possible to the opposite side. It's often used to center an item or push one item to the side.
` css .item-a { margin-right: auto; } /* Pushes item-a to left, remaining items to right */ .item-b { margin: auto; }      /* Centers item-b */  `

**Q224:** What is the initial value of `flex-direction`?
**A224:** `row`.

**Q225:** What is the initial value of `align-items`?
**A225:** `stretch`.

**Q226:** What is the initial value of `justify-content`?
**A226:** `flex-start`.

**Q227:** What is `flex-basis: auto;`?
**A227:** Means the item's initial size is determined by its content's size.

**Q228:** What is `flex-basis: 0;`?
**A228:** Means the item's initial size is zero, and its size will be determined purely by its `flex-grow` and `flex-shrink` values.

**Q229:** Can `flex-grow` be a decimal value?
**A229:** Yes, `flex-grow` can be any non-negative number.

**Q230:** How do you make all flex items take up equal space, regardless of their content?
**A230:** Apply `flex: 1;` to all flex items.

**Q231:** How do you make a specific flex item *not* shrink?
**A231:** Set `flex-shrink: 0;` on that item.

**Q232:** How do you make a specific flex item *not* grow?
**A232:** Set `flex-grow: 0;` on that item.

**Q233:** How do you reverse the order of items in a flex container?
**A233:** Set `flex-direction: row-reverse;` or `column-reverse;` on the container.

**Q234:** How do you push a single item to the end of a row in Flexbox without affecting others?
**A234:** Apply `margin-left: auto;` to that specific item.

**Q235:** What is `order: -1;` commonly used for?
**A235:** To make a specific flex item appear first in the visual order, regardless of its source order, as it has a lower `order` value than the default `0`.

**Q236:** Can you apply `align-self` to a flex container?
**A236:** No, `align-self` is a property for flex items, not containers. Containers use `align-items`.

**Q237:** What happens if `align-content` is used on a container with `flex-wrap: nowrap;`?
**A237:** Nothing. `align-content` only takes effect when there are multiple flex lines (i.e., when `flex-wrap` is set to `wrap` or `wrap-reverse`).

**Q238:** Can Flexbox items be block-level or inline-level elements?
**A238:** Flex items become "flex-level" boxes once they are inside a flex container. Their original `display` property (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`) has no effect on their behavior *as flex items*, but it can affect their internal content layout.

**Q239:** How would you create a navigation bar where links are evenly spaced horizontally and centered vertically?
**A239:**
` css nav ul { display: flex; justify-content: space-evenly; /* Evenly space items */ align-items: center; /* Center items vertically */ height: 60px; /* Example height */ list-style: none; /* Remove bullets */ padding: 0; margin: 0; }  `

**Q240:** How do you create a "holy grail" layout (header, footer, main content, two sidebars) using Flexbox?
**A240:** This typically requires nested flex containers. The main body could be a `column` flex container. The row containing the main content and sidebars would then be a `row` flex container.

**Q241:** What is the impact of `height: 100%;` on a flex item?
**A241:** If the flex container has a defined height and `align-items` is `stretch` (default), `height: 100%;` on a flex item will make it fill the available height of the container. If `align-items` is `flex-start`, `center`, etc., `height: 100%;` might still work but it's more common to rely on `stretch` or `align-self`.

**Q242:** What is `min-content` and `max-content` as values for `flex-basis` (or `width`/`height`)?
**A242:**

  * `min-content`: The smallest possible width an element can take without its content overflowing (e.g., width of the longest word).
  * `max-content`: The intrinsic preferred width of the content (e.g., width if all text were on a single line).

**Q243:** How do you make a flex item take up exactly 1/3 of the container width?
**A243:**
` css .flex-item { flex-basis: 33.333%; /* Initial size */ flex-grow: 1; /* Allow to grow */ flex-shrink: 1; /* Allow to shrink */ }  `
Or simply `flex: 1 1 33.333%;`.

**Q244:** How can you align items to the *end* of the cross axis, even if the container's `align-items` is `center`?
**A244:** Use `align-self: flex-end;` on the specific item.

**Q245:** What is the effect of `flex-direction: column-reverse;`?
**A245:** Flex items are arranged vertically (column), but the order is reversed, starting from the bottom of the container and stacking upwards.

**Q246:** What happens to the `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` of flex items when `flex-direction: row;`?
**A246:** `margin-top` and `margin-bottom` still work normally, creating vertical space. However, `margin: auto;` in the vertical direction will have no effect unless `align-items` is `flex-start` or `flex-end` (not `stretch`).

**Q247:** What happens to the `margin-left` and `margin-right` of flex items when `flex-direction: column;`?
**A247:** `margin-left` and `margin-right` still work normally, creating horizontal space. Similarly, `margin: auto;` in the horizontal direction will have no effect unless `justify-content` is `flex-start` or `flex-end` (not `stretch`).

**Q248:** Can you use `float` on a flex item?
**A248:** No, `float`, `clear`, and `vertical-align` have no effect on flex items.

**Q249:** What does `flex: none;` mean?
**A249:** `flex: none;` is a shorthand for `flex: 0 0 auto;`. It means the item will not grow (`flex-grow: 0`), will not shrink (`flex-shrink: 0`), and its size will be based on its content (`flex-basis: auto`). It acts like a rigid block inside the flex container.

**Q250:** How do you handle overflow of flex items when `flex-wrap` is `nowrap`?
**A250:** You would typically need to apply `overflow: auto;` or `overflow: scroll;` to the flex container (or a containing block) to introduce scrollbars, or manage the content dynamically with JavaScript.

## Part 6: CSS Grid (Q251-Q300)

**Q251:** What is CSS Grid Layout?
**A251:** CSS Grid Layout is a two-dimensional layout system that allows you to lay out elements in rows and columns simultaneously. It provides precise control over the placement and sizing of items on a grid.

**Q252:** How do you enable Grid for a container?
**A252:** By setting `display: grid;` or `display: inline-grid;` on the parent element.

**Q253:** What is the difference between a "grid container" and a "grid item"?
**A253:**

  * **Grid Container:** The parent element on which `display: grid;` is applied. It defines the grid structure (rows and columns).
  * **Grid Item:** The direct child elements of a grid container. They are placed within the grid cells.

**Q254:** How do you define grid columns? Provide an example.
**A254:** Using `grid-template-columns`.
` css grid-template-columns: 100px 1fr 2fr; /* 100px fixed, 1 part of remaining space, 2 parts of remaining space */  `

**Q255:** How do you define grid rows? Provide an example.
**A255:** Using `grid-template-rows`.
` css grid-template-rows: auto 200px 50px; /* Auto height, 200px fixed, 50px fixed */  `

**Q256:** What is the `fr` unit in CSS Grid?
**A256:** The `fr` (fraction) unit represents a fraction of the available space in the grid container. `1fr` means 1 part of the available space.

**Q257:** How do you create gaps between grid cells?
**A257:** Using the `gap` property (shorthand for `row-gap` and `column-gap`).
` css gap: 20px; /* 20px horizontal and vertical gap */ gap: 10px 20px; /* 10px row gap, 20px column gap */  `

**Q258:** How do you place a grid item by line numbers?
**A258:** Using `grid-column-start`, `grid-column-end`, `grid-row-start`, `grid-row-end`.
` css .item-a { grid-column-start: 2; grid-column-end: 4; /* Spans from line 2 to line 4 (i.e., 2 columns) */ }  `

**Q259:** What is the `span` keyword used for in grid item placement?
**A259:** The `span` keyword indicates how many tracks (columns or rows) an item should span.
` css .item-b { grid-column: span 2; /* Spans 2 columns */ grid-row: span 3; /* Spans 3 rows */ }  `

**Q260:** What is `grid-area`? How is it used?
**A260:** `grid-area` is a shorthand for `grid-row-start`, `grid-column-start`, `grid-row-end`, and `grid-column-end`. It can also be used to name a grid item so it can be placed in `grid-template-areas`.

**Q261:** How do you define grid areas by name?
**A261:** Using `grid-template-areas` on the container, where each string represents a row and names refer to `grid-area` of items.
` css .grid-container { grid-template-areas: "header header header" "nav    main   aside" "footer footer footer"; } .header { grid-area: header; } /* ... and so on for nav, main, aside, footer */  `

**Q262:** What does `repeat()` function do in grid template properties?
**A262:** `repeat()` allows you to repeat a section of track listings a specified number of times.
` css grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr); /* Creates 3 equal columns */ grid-template-rows: repeat(2, 50px auto); /* Creates rows like 50px auto 50px auto */  `

**Q263:** What does `auto-fill` and `auto-fit` do with `repeat()`?
**A263:** These keywords automatically create as many columns (or rows) as possible to fit the container.

  * `auto-fill`: Fills the row with as many columns as possible. If items don't fill the track, it still creates empty tracks.
  * `auto-fit`: Behaves like `auto-fill`, but *collapses* empty tracks if the items don't fill the row.

**Q264:** Provide an example of `grid-template-columns` using `auto-fit` and `minmax()`.
**A264:**
` css grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(200px, 1fr)); /* Creates as many columns as can fit, each at least 200px wide, and taking up equal fractional space if more than 200px is available. */  `

**Q265:** What does `minmax(min, max)` function do?
**A265:** Defines a size range for a grid track. The track will be no smaller than `min` and no larger than `max`.

**Q266:** What does `justify-items` control in Grid? Name common values.
**A266:** Aligns grid items along the **inline (row) axis** *within their individual grid cells*.

  * `stretch` (default)
  * `start`
  * `end`
  * `center`

**Q267:** What does `align-items` control in Grid? Name common values.
**A267:** Aligns grid items along the **block (column) axis** *within their individual grid cells*.

  * `stretch` (default)
  * `start`
  * `end`
  * `center`

**Q268:** What is the `place-items` shorthand property?
**A268:** A shorthand for `align-items` and `justify-items`.
` css place-items: center; /* Centers items both horizontally and vertically within cells */  `

**Q269:** What does `justify-content` control in Grid? Name common values.
**A269:** Aligns the **entire grid** along the **inline (row) axis** *within the grid container* when the grid is smaller than the container. (Values similar to Flexbox `justify-content`).

**Q270:** What does `align-content` control in Grid? Name common values.
**A270:** Aligns the **entire grid** along the **block (column) axis** *within the grid container* when the grid is smaller than the container. (Values similar to Flexbox `align-content`).

**Q271:** What is the `place-content` shorthand property?
**A271:** A shorthand for `align-content` and `justify-content`.
` css place-content: center; /* Centers the entire grid horizontally and vertically */  `

**Q272:** What does `justify-self` control for a grid item?
**A272:** Aligns a single grid item along the **inline (row) axis** *within its own cell*, overriding the container's `justify-items`.

**Q273:** What does `align-self` control for a grid item?
**A273:** Aligns a single grid item along the **block (column) axis** *within its own cell*, overriding the container's `align-items`.

**Q274:** What is the `place-self` shorthand property?
**A274:** A shorthand for `align-self` and `justify-self`.
` css .item-a { place-self: end center; /* Aligns to end of block axis, center of inline axis */ }  `

**Q275:** How does `grid-auto-flow` affect implicit grid item placement?
**A275:** `grid-auto-flow` controls how auto-placed grid items flow into the grid.

  * `row` (default): Items fill rows first, then move to the next row.
  * `column`: Items fill columns first, then move to the next column.
  * Can also be combined with `dense` to fill in smaller holes in the grid.

**Q276:** What are "implicit grid tracks"?
**A276:** Implicit grid tracks are rows or columns that are automatically created by the browser when there are more grid items than explicitly defined tracks, or when an item is placed outside the explicit grid.

**Q277:** What are `grid-auto-columns` and `grid-auto-rows`?
**A277:** These properties define the size of implicitly created grid tracks.
` css grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* All implicit rows will be 100px tall */  `

**Q278:** How do you name grid lines?
**A278:** By placing names in square brackets `[]` after the track size in `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows`.
` css grid-template-columns: [main-start] 1fr [col1-end] 2fr [main-end];  `

**Q279:** How do you place an item using named grid lines?
**A279:**
` css grid-column-start: main-start; grid-column-end: main-end;  `

**Q280:** What is the difference between `display: grid;` and `display: flex;`?
**A280:**

  * **Flexbox:** Primarily for **one-dimensional** layouts (row *or* column). Good for distributing items along a single axis.
  * **CSS Grid:** For **two-dimensional** layouts (rows *and* columns simultaneously). Provides more powerful control over positioning items on both axes.

**Q281:** Can you combine Flexbox and Grid? How?
**A281:** Yes, often referred to as "nested layouts." You can have a flex container as a grid item, or a grid container as a flex item. This allows for complex, responsive layouts.

**Q282:** What is `grid-column` and `grid-row` shorthand properties?
**A282:**

  * `grid-column`: Shorthand for `grid-column-start` and `grid-column-end`.
  * `grid-row`: Shorthand for `grid-row-start` and `grid-row-end`.
    Example: `grid-column: 1 / span 3;` (starts at line 1, spans 3 columns)

**Q283:** What is `grid` shorthand property?
**A283:** A shorthand for `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, `grid-template-areas`, `grid-auto-rows`, `grid-auto-columns`, and `grid-auto-flow`. It's very powerful but can be complex.

**Q284:** What is the meaning of `grid-template-columns: auto auto auto;`?
**A284:** Creates three columns, where each column's width is determined by the intrinsic width of its content.

**Q285:** How do you make a grid item span from the first column line to the last column line?
**A285:**
` css grid-column: 1 / -1;  `

**Q286:** Can `gap` work with Flexbox?
**A286:** Yes, `gap` (and `row-gap`/`column-gap`) properties are supported in Flexbox as well as Grid, providing a cleaner way to add spacing between items.

**Q287:** What is `grid-template` shorthand property?
**A287:** A shorthand for `grid-template-rows`, `grid-template-columns`, and `grid-template-areas`.

**Q288:** When would `inline-grid` be used over `grid`?
**A288:** `inline-grid` makes the grid container itself behave like an inline element (it won't take up the full width, won't start on a new line), while its direct children are still laid out as a grid. Useful for small components that need grid capabilities but should flow inline with text.

**Q289:** What is `grid-template-columns: max-content min-content auto;`?
**A289:**

  * First column: Takes the width of its largest content item.
  * Second column: Takes the smallest possible width without its content overflowing.
  * Third column: Takes up any remaining available space.

**Q290:** How do you stack grid items on top of each other in the same cell?
**A290:** By assigning them the same `grid-column` and `grid-row` values. This is common for overlay effects.

**Q291:** What is the `dense` keyword in `grid-auto-flow`?
**A291:** When combined with `row` or `column` (e.g., `grid-auto-flow: row dense;`), it tells the auto-placement algorithm to attempt to fill in any holes earlier in the grid, even if it means reordering items from their source order.

**Q292:** How can you align the entire grid content to the center of the container?
**A292:** Using `justify-content: center;` and `align-content: center;` on the grid container.

**Q293:** What happens if you define fewer items in `grid-template-areas` than your grid has columns/rows?
**A293:** Each string in `grid-template-areas` must define a complete row. If a string has fewer or more cells than the defined columns, it's an invalid declaration. If a named item is not used in `grid-template-areas`, it won't be explicitly placed.

**Q294:** What is the `subgrid` value for `grid-template-columns` or `grid-template-rows`?
**A294:** `subgrid` allows a nested grid to inherit the track sizing of its parent grid, creating a subgrid that aligns perfectly with the parent's tracks. This is part of CSS Grid Level 2 and has excellent browser support.

**Q295:** How do you create an explicit grid line with a custom name?
**A295:** `grid-template-columns: [start] 1fr [mid] 1fr [end];`

**Q296:** Can you apply `float` or `vertical-align` to a grid item?
**A296:** No, like flex items, grid items ignore `float`, `clear`, and `vertical-align` properties.

**Q297:** What is the `line` value for `grid-column` and `grid-row`?
**A297:** It refers to grid lines by their number or name.
` css grid-column: 1 / 3; /* From line 1 to line 3 */ grid-column: header-start / header-end; /* From named line to named line */  `

**Q298:** How can you debug CSS Grid layouts in browser developer tools?
**A298:** Modern browser developer tools (Chrome, Firefox, Edge) have excellent Grid inspectors. You can typically select the grid container and toggle a grid overlay to visualize grid lines, areas, and item placement.

**Q299:** What is the `grid-template-areas: ". . ." ". main ." ". . .";` pattern used for?
**A299:** This creates a 3x3 grid where only the center cell is named "main", effectively centering a single item within the grid and leaving the other cells empty or for auto-placement. The `.` denotes an unnamed (empty) cell.

**Q300:** When would you choose CSS Grid over Flexbox for a layout?
**A300:** Choose CSS Grid when you need to control layout in **two dimensions** (rows and columns simultaneously), when you have complex overlaps, or when the layout doesn't depend on the order of content in the source HTML. Choose Flexbox for **one-dimensional** (row OR column) distribution and alignment of items.

## Part 7: Responsive Design & Media Queries (Q301-Q350)

**Q301:** What is Responsive Web Design (RWD)?
**A301:** RWD is an approach to web design that aims to make web pages render well on a variety of devices and screen sizes, from minimal to maximum display (i.e., desktop, tablet, mobile).

**Q302:** What are Media Queries in CSS?
**A302:** Media Queries are a CSS3 feature that allows you to apply styles based on the characteristics of the device or viewport, such as screen width, height, resolution, and orientation.

**Q303:** What is the basic syntax of a Media Query?
**A303:**
` css @media media_type and (condition) { /* CSS rules go here */ }  `

**Q304:** Name common media types in Media Queries.
**A304:**

  * `all` (default): For all device types.
  * `screen`: For color computer screens.
  * `print`: For paged material and documents viewed in print preview.
  * `speech`: For speech synthesizers.

**Q305:** What are common media features used in Media Queries?
**A305:** `width`, `height`, `min-width`, `max-width`, `orientation`, `resolution`, `aspect-ratio`.

**Q306:** Provide an example of a Media Query for screens wider than 768px.
**A306:**
` css @media screen and (min-width: 769px) { /* Styles for larger screens */ }  `

**Q307:** Provide an example of a Media Query for screens up to 768px wide.
**A307:**
` css @media screen and (max-width: 768px) { /* Styles for smaller screens */ }  `

**Q308:** How do you target a specific range of screen widths?
**A308:** Using `and` to combine conditions.
` css @media screen and (min-width: 768px) and (max-width: 1024px) { /* Styles for tablets */ }  `

**Q309:** What is the `orientation` media feature? Name its values.
**A309:** Checks whether the device is in landscape or portrait mode.

  * `portrait`: Height is greater than or equal to width.
  * `landscape`: Width is greater than height.

**Q310:** What is the "mobile-first" approach in Responsive Web Design?
**A310:** It's a design strategy where you start by designing and coding for the smallest screen (mobile) first, then progressively enhance the design for larger screens using `min-width` media queries.

**Q311:** What are the advantages of the mobile-first approach?
**A311:** Better performance on mobile, forces a focus on essential content, improves accessibility, and often leads to cleaner code.

**Q312:** How does the `viewport` meta tag relate to Responsive Web Design?
**A312:** The `<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">` tag is crucial. It instructs the browser to set the viewport width to the device's width and set the initial zoom level. Without it, mobile browsers might render the page at a desktop width.

**Q313:** What is "fluid layout"?
**A313:** A layout that uses relative units (like percentages, `em`, `rem`, `vw`, `vh`) instead of fixed units (`px`) for widths, heights, and font sizes, allowing the layout to adjust smoothly as the screen size changes.

**Q314:** When designing responsively, when would you use `px` vs `em` vs `rem` vs `%`?
**A314:**

  * **`px`**: For properties that need exact pixel control, like borders, specific element sizes (sometimes), or when a fixed dimension is required.
  * **`em`**: For sizes relative to the *parent* font size, useful for consistent spacing around text.
  * **`rem`**: For font sizes and spacing relative to the *root* font size (`<html>`), good for global scaling and preventing compounding issues.
  * **`%`**: For widths and heights of elements relative to their *parent* container, creating fluid layouts.

**Q315:** What is the `prefers-color-scheme` media feature?
**A315:** Allows you to apply styles based on the user's preferred color scheme (e.g., light mode or dark mode) set at the operating system level.
` css @media (prefers-color-scheme: dark) { body { background-color: #333; color: white; } }  `

**Q316:** What is the `prefers-reduced-motion` media feature?
**A316:** Allows you to provide alternative styles for users who prefer reduced motion (e.g., less animation) due to vestibular disorders or other sensitivities.
` css @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) { * { animation-duration: 0.01ms !important; transition-duration: 0.01ms !important; animation-iteration-count: 1 !important; } }  `

**Q317:** What is the `min-device-width` vs `min-width` media feature? Which is generally preferred?
**A317:**

  * `min-device-width`: Refers to the physical width of the device's screen.
  * `min-width`: Refers to the width of the browser's viewport.
    `min-width` is generally preferred because users can resize browser windows on desktop, and it's more relevant to the actual rendering space available, not just the device's physical screen size.

**Q318:** How do you target devices with high pixel density (Retina displays) for images?
**A318:** Using `resolution` or `min-resolution` media features, often combined with `image-set()` or `srcset` in HTML.
` css @media (-webkit-min-device-pixel-ratio: 2), (min-resolution: 192dpi) { .my-image { background-image: url('image@2x.png'); /* Load higher resolution image */ background-size: 100px 100px; /* If original image is 200x200 for 100x100 space */ } }  `

**Q319:** What is a "breakpoint" in responsive design?
**A319:** A breakpoint is a specific screen width (or other media feature value) at which the layout or design of a website changes significantly (e.g., from a three-column desktop layout to a single-column mobile layout).

**Q320:** How do you hide an element specifically for print media?
**A320:**
` css @media print { .no-print { display: none; } }  `

**Q321:** What is the purpose of `@import` in CSS?
**A321:** `@import` allows you to import other CSS stylesheets into the current one. It can also include media queries directly.
` css @import url("mobile.css") screen and (max-width: 600px);  `
*Note: `<link>` is generally preferred for performance as `@import` can cause render-blocking issues.*

**Q322:** Why is `box-sizing: border-box;` important for responsive design?
**A322:** It simplifies layout calculations, especially with percentages. When `width` is set to `50%`, the padding and border are included *within* that 50%, preventing unexpected horizontal scrolling due to elements overflowing their containers.

**Q323:** What are CSS viewport units (`vw`, `vh`, `vmin`, `vmax`)?
**A323:**

  * `vw`: 1% of the viewport's width.
  * `vh`: 1% of the viewport's height.
  * `vmin`: 1% of the smaller dimension (width or height) of the viewport.
  * `vmax`: 1% of the larger dimension (width or height) of the viewport.
    Useful for elements that need to scale directly with the viewport size.

**Q324:** How do you create an "off-canvas" navigation menu for small screens using CSS?
**A324:** This usually involves positioning the menu off-screen (`left: -100%;` or `transform: translateX(-100%);`) and then using a CSS transition triggered by a class added via JavaScript to slide it into view. Media queries determine when this behavior is active.

**Q325:** What is `calc()` function in CSS? When is it useful in responsive design?
**A325:** `calc()` allows you to perform mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to determine CSS property values.
` css width: calc(100% - 40px); /* 100% of parent width minus a fixed 40px */  `
Useful for dynamic layouts where dimensions are a mix of fixed and fluid values, e.g., for creating gutters or offsetting elements.

**Q326:** How can you set a minimum font size for very small screens and a maximum for very large screens using CSS alone (without JavaScript)?
**A326:** Using viewport units combined with `clamp()` or `calc()` inside `font-size` is one way for fluid typography:
` css font-size: clamp(1rem, 2vw + 1rem, 2.5rem); /* min-size, fluid-size, max-size */  `

**Q327:** What is `clamp()` function?
**A327:** `clamp(MIN, VAL, MAX)` clamps a value between an inclusive lower bound (`MIN`) and an inclusive upper bound (`MAX`). `VAL` is the preferred value. If `VAL` is less than `MIN`, `MIN` is used. If `VAL` is greater than `MAX`, `MAX` is used. Otherwise, `VAL` is used. It's powerful for fluid typography and spacing.

**Q328:** How do you change the number of columns in a multi-column layout based on screen size?
**A328:**
\`\`\`css
.content-columns {
columns: 1; /\* Default for mobile \*/
}

````
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .content-columns {
    columns: 2; /* Two columns on larger screens */
  }
}
```
````

**Q329:** How do you optimize images for responsive design using CSS?
**A329:**

  * Use `max-width: 100%;` on images to prevent overflow.
  * Use `height: auto;` to maintain aspect ratio.
  * Use `object-fit` and `object-position` for fitting images into specific containers.
  * Use `srcset` and `<picture>` in HTML for different resolutions/sizes/formats.
  * Consider using background images with `background-size: cover;` for hero sections.

**Q330:** What are `minmax()` and `fit-content()` functions in CSS Grid and how are they useful for responsiveness?
**A330:**

  * `minmax(min, max)`: Defines a size range for a grid track. Useful for creating responsive columns where a column is at least `min` size but can grow up to `max` (e.g., `minmax(200px, 1fr)`).
  * `fit-content(length)`: Uses the available space, but never more than `length` and never less than `min-content`. Useful for columns that should size to their content but not grow indefinitely.

**Q331:** How can you use Flexbox for responsive navigation?
**A331:**

  * Set `display: flex;` on the nav container.
  * Use `justify-content: space-around;` or `space-between;` for even spacing.
  * On small screens, change `flex-direction: column;` via a media query to stack items vertically.

**Q332:** How can you use CSS Grid for a responsive header?
**A332:**
` css header { display: grid; grid-template-columns: auto 1fr auto; /* Logo, Space, Nav */ align-items: center; } @media (max-width: 600px) { header { grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Stack items vertically */ grid-template-rows: auto auto auto; justify-items: center; /* Center items */ } }  `

**Q333:** What is `display: flow-root;`? When is it useful?
**A333:** `display: flow-root;` creates a new Block Formatting Context (BFC) for its content. It's a modern alternative to the clearfix hack for containing floats within an element.

**Q334:** What is the difference between `width: auto;` and `width: 100%;`?
**A334:**

  * `width: auto;`: The element's width is determined by the browser, often expanding to fill available space or shrinking to fit content, respecting its `display` type and other layout properties.
  * `width: 100%;`: The element's width is explicitly set to 100% of its parent's content width. With `box-sizing: content-box;` this can cause horizontal overflow if padding/border are also applied.

**Q335:** What is the `only` keyword in Media Queries?
**A335:** The `only` keyword is used to hide the style sheet from older browsers that do not support media queries.
` css @media only screen and (min-width: 900px) { ... }  `

**Q336:** What is the `not` operator in Media Queries?
**A336:** The `not` operator negates the result of the entire media query.
` css @media not screen and (color) { ... } /* Applies to non-color screens */  `

**Q337:** What is a common practice for including multiple external stylesheets for different devices?
**A337:** You can include multiple `<link>` tags with `media` attributes.
` html <link rel="stylesheet" href="small.css" media="screen and (max-width: 600px)"> <link rel="stylesheet" href="large.css" media="screen and (min-width: 601px)">  `

**Q338:** Why is placing `min-width` queries *after* base styles important in a mobile-first approach?
**A338:** CSS rules are applied based on source order when specificity is equal. In a mobile-first approach, base styles for mobile are applied first. Then, `min-width` queries layered *after* them will override those base styles for larger screens, following the cascade.

**Q339:** What is a "relative" font size, and how is it beneficial for responsiveness?
**A339:** Relative font sizes (using `em`, `rem`, `vw`) scale proportionally to a base font size or the viewport. This ensures that text remains readable and proportions are maintained across different screen sizes, without needing to adjust every font size at every breakpoint.

**Q340:** How can you prevent horizontal scrollbars on a page due to overflowing content?
**A340:**

  * Use `box-sizing: border-box;` universally.
  * Ensure images have `max-width: 100%;`.
  * Use fluid units (`%`, `vw`, `fr`).
  * Be cautious with fixed widths and large padding/margins inside fluid containers.
  * Use `overflow-x: hidden;` on the `body` or `html` as a last resort, but identify the overflowing element.

**Q341:** What is the `contain` property in CSS? When is it useful?
**A341:** The `contain` property allows browsers to render parts of the page in isolation, improving performance. It can control layout, style, size, and paint containment. Useful for complex widgets or sections to prevent their rendering from affecting other parts of the page.

**Q342:** How can you make a responsive image fill its container while cropping excess?
**A342:**
` css img { width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; }  `

**Q343:** What is `aspect-ratio` property in CSS?
**A343:** The `aspect-ratio` property sets a preferred aspect ratio for the box, which will be used in the calculation of auto sizes and other layout functions. It's a modern way to size elements (especially images/videos) proportionally without padding hacks.
` css .video-container { aspect-ratio: 16 / 9; /* Maintains a 16:9 aspect ratio */ width: 100%; }  `

**Q344:** What is `font-size-adjust`?
**A344:** `font-size-adjust` allows you to adjust the x-height of a font relative to its `font-size`. This helps maintain readability when changing font families, as x-height (the height of lowercase 'x') can vary greatly between fonts.

**Q345:** What are `min-content` and `max-content` keywords used for in responsive sizing?
**A345:** They provide intrinsic sizing.

  * `min-content`: Represents the smallest size an element can take without its content overflowing (e.g., width of the longest word).
  * `max-content`: Represents the ideal size an element would take if there were no constraints, allowing content to display on a single line.
    Useful with Flexbox and Grid for more flexible item sizing.

**Q346:** What is the `fit-content()` sizing keyword?
**A346:** `fit-content()` uses the available space, but never more than the specified argument (if any) and never less than `min-content`. It's a dynamic sizing function often used in grid and flex layouts.

**Q347:** How would you implement a simple full-width hero section that scales with the viewport height?
**A347:**
` css .hero-section { height: 100vh; /* Takes full viewport height */ width: 100vw; /* Takes full viewport width */ background-size: cover; display: flex; /* For content alignment */ justify-content: center; align-items: center; }  `

**Q348:** What is `container queries`? (Briefly explain as it's an emerging feature)
**A348:** Container queries (using `@container`) allow you to style elements based on the size of their *parent container* (or any ancestor), rather than the global viewport size. This enables more modular and component-based responsive design.

**Q349:** Why is it crucial to test responsive designs on actual devices?
**A349:** Browser developer tools provide good emulations, but actual devices have subtle differences in rendering engines, touch interactions, pixel densities, and network conditions that emulators cannot perfectly replicate.

**Q350:** How does `line-height` contribute to responsive text readability?
**A350:** Setting `line-height` with unitless values (e.g., `1.5`) ensures that the vertical spacing between lines scales proportionally with the font size. This maintains good readability as font size adjusts across different screen sizes.

## Part 8: Transitions, Transforms & Animations (Q351-Q400)

**Q351:** What are CSS Transitions?
**A351:** CSS Transitions provide a way to animate changes in CSS properties smoothly over a specified duration, rather than instantaneously.

**Q352:** What are the four core properties of a CSS transition?
**A352:** `transition-property`, `transition-duration`, `transition-timing-function`, `transition-delay`.

**Q353:** What is `transition-property`?
**A353:** Specifies the CSS property (or properties) that the transition effect will apply to (e.g., `all`, `background-color`, `transform`).

**Q354:** What is `transition-duration`?
**A354:** Specifies the length of time a transition animation should take to complete (e.g., `0.5s`, `300ms`).

**Q355:** What is `transition-timing-function`? Name common values.
**A355:** Specifies the speed curve of the transition.

  * `ease` (default): Slow start, fast middle, slow end.
  * `linear`: Same speed from start to end.
  * `ease-in`: Slow start.
  * `ease-out`: Slow end.
  * `ease-in-out`: Slow start and end.
  * `cubic-bezier(n,n,n,n)`: Custom curve.

**Q356:** What is `transition-delay`?
**A356:** Specifies a delay before the transition effect starts (e.g., `0.2s`).

**Q357:** Provide an example of the `transition` shorthand property.
**A357:**
` css .button { transition: background-color 0.3s ease-in-out 0.1s; /* property duration timing-function delay */ }  `

**Q358:** How do you apply a transition to all properties?
**A358:** Use `transition-property: all;` or simply `transition: all ...;`.

**Q359:** What are CSS Transforms?
**A359:** CSS Transforms allow you to apply 2D or 3D transformations to an element, such as moving, rotating, scaling, or skewing, without affecting the document flow.

**Q360:** Name common 2D transform functions.
**A360:** `translate()`, `rotate()`, `scale()`, `skew()`, `matrix()`.

**Q361:** Name common 3D transform functions.
**A361:** `translate3d()`, `rotateX()`, `rotateY()`, `rotateZ()`, `scale3d()`, `perspective()`, `matrix3d()`.

**Q362:** How do you move an element along the X and Y axes using `transform`?
**A362:** Using `translate(x, y)` or `translateX(x)` and `translateY(y)`.
` css transform: translate(50px, 100px);  `

**Q363:** How do you rotate an element?
**A363:** Using `rotate(angle)` for 2D or `rotateX()`, `rotateY()`, `rotateZ()` for 3D.
` css transform: rotate(45deg); /* 2D rotation */  `

**Q364:** How do you scale an element?
**A364:** Using `scale(x, y)` or `scaleX(x)` and `scaleY(y)`. `scale(2)` doubles both width and height.
` css transform: scale(1.2); /* Make it 20% larger */  `

**Q365:** What is `transform-origin`?
**A365:** `transform-origin` specifies the point around which a transformation is applied. Default is `center center` (50% 50%).
` css transform-origin: top left; /* Rotate/scale from the top-left corner */  `

**Q366:** What are CSS Animations?
**A366:** CSS Animations allow for more complex, multi-step animations than transitions. They define a sequence of styles over time using keyframes.

**Q367:** What is `@keyframes` rule used for?
**A367:** `@keyframes` defines the different stages (keyframes) of an animation. You specify styles at various percentages of the animation's duration (e.g., `0%`, `50%`, `100%`).

**Q368:** Provide a basic `@keyframes` example.
**A368:**
` css @keyframes slideIn { 0% { transform: translateX(-100%); opacity: 0; } 50% { opacity: 0.5; } 100% { transform: translateX(0); opacity: 1; } }  `

**Q369:** What are the key properties to apply an animation to an element?
**A369:** `animation-name` and `animation-duration`. Other common ones: `animation-timing-function`, `animation-delay`, `animation-iteration-count`, `animation-direction`.

**Q370:** Provide an example of applying an animation.
**A370:**
` css .element { animation-name: slideIn; animation-duration: 1s; animation-iteration-count: infinite; /* Loop forever */ animation-timing-function: ease-out; }  `

**Q371:** What is `animation-iteration-count`?
**A371:** Specifies how many times an animation should play (`infinite` for continuous loop, or a number).

**Q372:** What is `animation-direction`? Name common values.
**A372:** Specifies whether an animation should play forwards, backwards, or alternate direction each cycle.

  * `normal` (default): Forwards.
  * `reverse`: Backwards.
  * `alternate`: Forwards then backwards.
  * `alternate-reverse`: Backwards then forwards.

**Q373:** What is `animation-fill-mode`? Name common values.
**A373:** Specifies how an element's styles are applied before and after the animation.

  * `none` (default): Styles are reset at the end.
  * `forwards`: Element retains the styles from the last keyframe when animation ends.
  * `backwards`: Element applies styles from the first keyframe (or `from`) during the `animation-delay` period.
  * `both`: Applies `forwards` and `backwards` behavior.

**Q374:** What is the `animation` shorthand property?
**A374:** A shorthand for all animation properties.
` css animation: slideIn 1s infinite ease-out forwards; /* name duration iteration-count timing-function fill-mode */  `

**Q375:** What is `transform-style` for?
**A375:** Used on a parent element to specify how its children are rendered in 3D space, either flattened or preserving 3D position.

  * `flat` (default): All children are flattened into the 2D plane of the parent.
  * `preserve-3d`: Children retain their 3D positioning.

**Q376:** What is `perspective` property used for in 3D transforms?
**A376:** Applied to the *parent* of 3D transformed elements, `perspective` gives a sense of depth by defining the strength of the 3D perspective effect. A smaller value creates a more extreme perspective.

**Q377:** What is `perspective-origin`?
**A377:** Sets the origin of the perspective for 3D transforms. Default is `center`.

**Q378:** What is `backface-visibility`?
**A378:** Controls whether the "back" side of a 3D-transformed element (when rotated to face away from the viewer) is visible. Useful for flip effects.

  * `visible` (default): Backface is visible.
  * `hidden`: Backface is hidden.

**Q379:** Can you chain multiple `transform` functions? Provide an example.
**A379:** Yes, apply them in a single `transform` property value. The order matters.
` css transform: translateX(100px) rotate(90deg) scale(1.5);  `

**Q380:** What is the `matrix()` transform function?
**A380:** `matrix()` is a complex 2D transform function that combines translate, scale, rotate, and skew operations into a single matrix. It's rarely used directly but is how browsers perform combinations of simpler transforms internally.

**Q381:** How do you pause an animation?
**A381:** Using `animation-play-state: paused;` (e.g., on `:hover`).
` css .element:hover { animation-play-state: paused; }  `

**Q382:** How do you make an animation run only once?
**A382:** Set `animation-iteration-count: 1;`.

**Q383:** What is the `@property` rule? (An emerging standard)
**A383:** The `@property` at-rule allows you to register custom CSS properties (variables) directly in CSS, giving them a defined syntax, initial value, and inheritance behavior. This enables animating custom properties.

**Q384:** Can you animate `background-position` with transitions?
**A384:** Yes, `background-position` can be animated with CSS transitions.

**Q385:** What is hardware acceleration in CSS animations/transforms?
**A385:** Hardware acceleration (or GPU acceleration) offloads the rendering of animations and transforms to the graphics processing unit (GPU) instead of the CPU. This results in smoother, higher-performance animations. Properties like `transform` and `opacity` are typically hardware-accelerated.

**Q386:** How can you force hardware acceleration for a property that might not be by default?
**A386:** By using a "hack" like `transform: translateZ(0);` or `will-change: transform;` on the element. However, `will-change` should be used sparingly as it can consume resources.

**Q387:** What is `will-change` property?
**A387:** `will-change` informs the browser about properties that are expected to change in the future. This allows the browser to make optimizations *before* the change actually happens, potentially improving animation performance (e.g., by preparing layers on the GPU).

**Q388:** What is `animation-delay`?
**A388:** `animation-delay` specifies how long to wait before the animation starts playing.

**Q389:** What is `animation-duration`?
**A389:** `animation-duration` specifies how long the animation takes to complete one cycle.

**Q390:** What is `animation-name`?
**A390:** `animation-name` specifies the name of the `@keyframes` rule that describes the animation.

**Q391:** Can you have multiple animations on a single element?
**A391:** Yes, separate them with commas in the `animation` shorthand or individual animation properties.
` css animation: bounce 1s ease-out, fadeOut 2s linear 1s forwards;  `

**Q392:** What are common use cases for CSS Transitions?
**A392:** Simple hover effects, changing button colors on click, sliding in/out side menus, fading elements.

**Q393:** What are common use cases for CSS Animations?
**A393:** Complex multi-step animations, loading spinners, character movements, parallax effects, interactive elements with distinct phases.

**Q394:** What is the `step-start` and `step-end` timing function?
**A394:** These are step timing functions that make transitions or animations jump immediately from one state to the next without a smooth transition.

  * `step-start`: Jumps immediately to the end of each step.
  * `step-end`: Jumps at the beginning of each step.

**Q395:** What is `steps(n, [start|end])` timing function?
**A395:** Divides the animation into `n` equal steps. The optional second parameter specifies whether the change occurs at the `start` (default) or `end` of each step. Useful for sprite animations.

**Q396:** How do you create an infinite loading spinner using CSS animation?
**A396:**
` css @keyframes spin { from { transform: rotate(0deg); } to { transform: rotate(360deg); } } .spinner { border: 4px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1); border-top-color: #333; border-radius: 50%; width: 30px; height: 30px; animation: spin 1s linear infinite; }  `

**Q397:** Can you animate between `display: none;` and `display: block;`? Why/Why not?
**A397:** No, you cannot directly animate between `display: none;` and `display: block;`. `display` is a discrete property; it changes instantly. For show/hide animations, use `opacity` or `transform` along with `visibility` or `height` (e.g., animating `height` from 0 to `auto`).

**Q398:** What is `transform: skew(angleX, angleY)`?
**A398:** Skews an element along the X and/or Y axes, distorting its shape.

**Q399:** What is the `filter` property used for?
**A399:** `filter` applies visual effects (like blur, brightness, contrast, grayscale, sepia, hue-rotate) to an element's rendering before it's displayed.
` css img { filter: grayscale(100%); /* Makes image grayscale */ }  `

**Q400:** What is `backdrop-filter`? How does it differ from `filter`?
**A400:** `backdrop-filter` applies graphic effects to the area *behind* an element, typically used for frosted glass or blurred background effects. Unlike `filter` (which applies to the element itself), `backdrop-filter` affects what's *behind* the element and requires some transparency on the element itself to be visible.

## Part 9: Advanced CSS Features & Best Practices (Q401-Q450)

**Q401:** What are CSS Custom Properties (CSS Variables)?
**A401:** Custom properties (defined with `--` prefix, e.g., `--primary-color: blue;`) allow you to define reusable values in CSS. They are inherited and can be accessed with `var()`.

**Q402:** How do you define a CSS Custom Property and use it?
**A402:**
\`\`\`css
:root {
\--main-color: \#007bff;
\--spacing-unit: 16px;
}

````
.button {
  background-color: var(--main-color);
  padding: var(--spacing-unit);
}
```
````

**Q403:** What are the advantages of using CSS Custom Properties?
**A403:**

  * **Maintainability:** Easier to manage global styles from a single place.
  * **Theming:** Easily switch themes by changing a few variable values.
  * **Readability:** Code becomes more semantic.
  * **Dynamic Updates:** Can be updated dynamically with JavaScript.
  * **Inheritance:** Values are inherited down the cascade.

**Q404:** What is the `var()` function used for with Custom Properties?
**A404:** `var()` is used to retrieve the value of a custom property. It can also take a fallback value.
` css color: var(--text-color, black); /* Use --text-color, fallback to black if not defined */  `

**Q405:** What is the purpose of the `calc()` function? Provide an example.
**A405:** `calc()` allows you to perform mathematical calculations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) within CSS property values. Useful for combining different units.
` css width: calc(50% - 20px);  `

**Q406:** What are CSS Preprocessors? Name two popular ones.
**A406:** CSS Preprocessors are scripting languages that extend CSS with features like variables, nesting, mixins, functions, and inheritance. The code is then compiled into standard CSS. Popular ones include Sass (SCSS), Less, and Stylus.

**Q407:** What are the advantages of using CSS Preprocessors?
**A407:**

  * **Modularity:** Break down stylesheets into smaller, manageable files.
  * **Reusability:** Mixins and functions promote code reuse.
  * **Maintainability:** Variables make it easier to manage themes and global values.
  * **Readability:** Nesting can reflect HTML structure.
  * **Less Repetition:** Reduces redundant code.

**Q408:** What are CSS Postprocessors? Name a popular tool.
**A408:** CSS Postprocessors are tools that take valid CSS as input and process it further to perform tasks like adding vendor prefixes, minifying, linting, or transpiling future CSS syntax. PostCSS is a popular tool (often used with plugins like Autoprefixer).

**Q409:** What is Autoprefixer and what problem does it solve?
**A409:** Autoprefixer is a PostCSS plugin that automatically adds vendor prefixes (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, `-ms-`) to CSS rules based on Can I Use data and specified browser support. It solves the problem of manually writing and maintaining vendor prefixes for cross-browser compatibility.

**Q410:** What are "vendor prefixes" in CSS? Why were they used?
**A401:** Vendor prefixes (e.g., `-webkit-`, `-moz-`, `-ms-`, `-o-`) were prefixes added to experimental or non-standard CSS properties by browser vendors. They allowed developers to use new features before they were fully standardized, while preventing conflicts with official property names. Most are no longer needed for common properties.

**Q411:** What is CSS Minification? Why is it beneficial?
**A411:** CSS minification is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from CSS source code (whitespace, comments, last semicolons, etc.) without changing its functionality. It significantly reduces file size, leading to faster download times and improved page load performance.

**Q412:** What is Critical CSS? Why is it important for performance?
**A412:** Critical CSS (or "above-the-fold CSS") refers to the CSS rules required to render the content visible in the user's initial viewport without scrolling. It's important for performance because by inlining this small amount of CSS in the HTML `<head>`, the browser can render the visible content immediately without waiting for the full external stylesheet to download, improving perceived load speed.

**Q413:** What are CSS Methodologies? Name two popular ones.
**A413:** CSS Methodologies are structured approaches or conventions for writing and organizing CSS code to make it more maintainable, scalable, and reusable, especially in large projects. Popular ones include BEM (Block, Element, Modifier) and SMACSS (Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS).

**Q441:** Explain BEM methodology.
**A441:** BEM stands for Block, Element, Modifier. It's a naming convention for CSS classes that helps organize and create reusable components.

  * **Block:** A standalone entity (e.g., `.`card` ,  `.button\`).
  * **Element:** A part of a block that has no standalone meaning (e.g., `.card__header`, `.button__icon`).
  * **Modifier:** A flag on a block or element to change its appearance or behavior (e.g., `.card--dark`, `.button--large`).

**Q415:** What is the `rem` unit often used for in responsive design?
**A415:** For font sizes and sometimes for spacing (margins/padding) because it scales relative to the root `<html>` element's font size, providing consistent scaling across the entire document.

**Q416:** What is the `currentColor` keyword?
**A416:** `currentColor` represents the computed value of the `color` property of an element. It's useful for making an element's border, background, or other properties automatically match its text color.

**Q417:** What is `image-rendering`?
**A417:** `image-rendering` hints to the browser how to render an image when it's scaled up or down. Values include `auto`, `crisp-edges` (for pixel art), and `pixelated`.

**Q418:** What is `mix-blend-mode`?
**A418:** Defines how an element's content should blend with its direct background. Similar to blend modes in graphics software (e.g., `multiply`, `screen`, `overlay`, `difference`).

**Q419:** What is `isolation` property?
**A419:** `isolation: isolate;` creates a new stacking context and is used in conjunction with `mix-blend-mode` to ensure elements blend only with their immediate backdrop, not elements outside their stacking context.

**Q420:** What are `mask-image` and `mask-mode`?
**A420:** CSS Masking allows using an image or SVG as a mask to partially or fully hide an element.

  * `mask-image`: Specifies the mask image.
  * `mask-mode`: Defines whether the mask should be interpreted as a luminance mask or an alpha mask.

**Q421:** What is `clip` property? Is it still commonly used?
**A421:** The `clip` property (deprecated in favor of `clip-path`) allowed clipping an absolutely positioned element to a specific rectangle. It's no longer commonly used as `clip-path` is much more flexible.

**Q422:** What are CSS `scroll-snap` properties?
**A422:** `scroll-snap` properties (e.g., `scroll-snap-type`, `scroll-snap-align`) enable scroll containers to "snap" to specific points as the user scrolls, creating a more controlled and smooth scrolling experience, common for carousels or full-screen sections.

**Q423:** How can you use CSS to prevent scroll chaining (overscroll behavior)?
**A423:** Using the `overscroll-behavior` property.

  * `overscroll-behavior: contain;` prevents scrolling from propagating to the parent element.
  * `overscroll-behavior: none;` prevents both propagation and the default browser overscroll effects (like "pull-to-refresh").

**Q444:** What is `contain-intrinsic-size`?
**A444:** Used with the `contain` property (`contain: size;`) to give the browser a hint about the natural size of a contained element, so it can reserve space for it without having to render its content, improving layout performance.

**Q425:** What are `logical properties` in CSS? Provide an example.
**A425:** Logical properties are modern CSS properties that refer to directions based on the content flow direction (writing mode) rather than physical directions (top/right/bottom/left).

  * Instead of `margin-left`, use `margin-inline-start`.
  * Instead of `margin-right`, use `margin-inline-end`.
  * Instead of `padding-top`, use `padding-block-start`.
    They make layouts more adaptable to different writing systems (e.g., left-to-right, right-to-left, vertical).

**Q426:** Why are logical properties beneficial for internationalization?
**A426:** They automatically adapt to different `writing-mode` and `direction` settings. For example, `padding-inline-start` will automatically apply to the left in LTR languages and to the right in RTL languages, reducing the need for separate CSS rules for different language directions.

**Q427:** What is `initial-letter` property?
**A427:** Allows styling the first letter of a text block like a drop cap, spanning across multiple lines.

**Q428:** What is `font-optical-sizing`?
**A428:** Allows the browser to automatically adjust font characteristics for optimal legibility at different font sizes (if the font supports it).

**Q429:** What is `font-variation-settings`?
**A429:** Low-level property for controlling "variable fonts," allowing fine-grained adjustments to various font axes (e.g., weight, width, optical size) beyond typical `font-weight` or `font-stretch`.

**Q430:** What is the `accent-color` property?
**A430:** `accent-color` allows you to set the color of certain user interface elements (like checkboxes, radio buttons, range sliders) to match your brand's color scheme.

**Q431:** What is `image-set()` function?
**A431:** `image-set()` is a CSS function that allows you to specify different image resolutions for different pixel densities (e.g., for Retina displays) similar to `srcset` in HTML.
` css background-image: image-set( url("image.png") 1x, url("image@2x.png") 2x );  `

**Q432:** What is `backdrop-filter` used for, and what's a common use case?
**A432:** Applies graphical effects to the background behind an element. A common use case is creating a "frosted glass" effect, where a semi-transparent overlay blurs the content behind it.

**Q433:** What is `clip-path`'s relationship with `transform`?
**A433:** `clip-path` defines the visible region of an element, while `transform` moves, rotates, or scales the entire element. You can apply both, and `transform` applies *after* `clip-path` has determined the visible area.

**Q434:** What are "custom units" in CSS? (Not standard, but concept)
**A434:** While CSS itself doesn't allow defining arbitrary custom units (like `1myunit`), you can achieve similar flexibility using CSS Custom Properties to define a base unit, then using `calc()` for calculations.

**Q435:** How can you apply styles conditionally based on the user's browser?
**A435:** This is generally done using JavaScript to detect the browser and add a class to the `<body>` or `<html>` element, then styling based on that class. Directly targeting browsers in CSS with vendor prefixes is not reliable or recommended for general styling.

**Q436:** What is `mask-border`?
**A436:** `mask-border` is a shorthand for masking an element's border with an image, similar to `border-image`, but for transparency/clipping.

**Q437:** What is `contain: size;` property?
**A437:** `contain: size;` tells the browser that the element's size is independent of its content and its descendants. This allows the browser to optimize layout calculations, as it knows the element's size won't change based on content.

**Q438:** What is `contain: layout;` property?
**A438:** `contain: layout;` tells the browser that the element's internal layout does not affect its parent's layout, and external layout does not affect its internal layout. This is a performance optimization.

**Q439:** What is `contain: style;` property?
**A439:** `contain: style;` tells the browser that styles from outside the element cannot affect the styles of its children, and vice versa. This is rare to use and primarily for very specific performance optimizations.

**Q440:** What is `contain: paint;` property?
**A440:** `contain: paint;` tells the browser that the descendants of the element do not display outside its bounds. This prevents the browser from having to check other elements for painting optimizations.

**Q441:** How do you disable the native scrolling behavior on a specific element while keeping its content scrollable programmatically?
**A441:** Set `overflow: hidden;` and then use JavaScript to control the `scrollTop` or `scrollLeft` property.

**Q442:** What is the `box-decoration-break` property?
**A442:** `box-decoration-break` specifies how the background, padding, border, and margin of a box element are rendered when the element is fragmented (e.g., when a line break occurs within an inline element with a background/border).

**Q443:** What is `font-display: optional;`?
**A443:** Gives the font face a very small block period, a small swap period, and then a failure period. It means the browser will only use the custom font if it's downloaded extremely quickly; otherwise, it will stick to the fallback font to avoid any visible reflow.

**Q444:** What is `text-emphasis`?
**A444:** `text-emphasis` applies emphasis marks to text (e.g., dots or circles above characters), often used in East Asian typography.

**Q445:** What is `column-rule`?
**A445:** `column-rule` is a shorthand for `column-rule-width`, `column-rule-style`, and `column-rule-color`, which draws a line between columns in a multi-column layout.

**Q446:** What is `break-before` and `break-after`?
**A446:** These properties specify how column, page, or region breaks should behave before or after an element. Useful for print layouts or multi-column text.

**Q447:** What is `text-combine-upright`?
**A447:** `text-combine-upright` combines multiple characters into a single upright character within vertical text, common for numbers or short phrases in vertical writing modes.

**Q448:** What is `user-scalable=no` in the viewport meta tag? Is it recommended?
**A448:** `user-scalable=no` prevents users from zooming in or out on a webpage on mobile devices. It is **highly discouraged** as it significantly harms accessibility, especially for visually impaired users who rely on zooming to read content.

**Q449:** What are "CSS Modules"? (Briefly explain as a concept)
**A449:** CSS Modules are a concept (not a native CSS feature) used in modern JavaScript frameworks (like React, Vue) where CSS classes are locally scoped by default. This solves the problem of global CSS scope collisions, making styles more modular and isolated to components.

**Q450:** How do you implement "dark mode" using CSS and JavaScript?
**A450:**

1.  **CSS:** Use `@media (prefers-color-scheme: dark)` for automatic dark mode based on user's OS settings.
2.  **JavaScript:** For a user-toggleable dark mode button:
      * Add/remove a class (e.g., `dark-mode`) to the `<body>` or `<html>` element.
      * In CSS, define `dark-mode` specific styles:
        ```css
        body.dark-mode {
          background-color: #333;
          color: white;
        }
        ```

## Part 10: Miscellaneous & Advanced Concepts (Q451-Q500)

**Q451:** What is the `counter-reset` property?
**A451:** `counter-reset` initializes or resets one or more CSS counters to a specified value.

**Q452:** What is the `counter-increment` property?
**A452:** `counter-increment` increases or decreases the value of one or more CSS counters.

**Q453:** How do you display a counter's value in content?
**A453:** Using the `counter()` or `counters()` function within the `content` property of `::before` or `::after`.

**Q454:** What is `list-style-type`?
**A454:** Specifies the type of list item marker (e.g., `disc`, `circle`, `square`, `decimal`, `lower-alpha`, `none`).

**Q455:** What is `list-style-image`?
**A455:** Sets an image as the list item marker.

**Q456:** What is `list-style-position`?
**A456:** Specifies whether the list-item marker is inside or outside the content flow of the list item.

  * `outside` (default): Marker is outside.
  * `inside`: Marker is inside.

**Q457:** What is the `list-style` shorthand?
**A457:** A shorthand for `list-style-type`, `list-style-position`, and `list-style-image`.

**Q458:** What is `tab-size`?
**A458:** The `tab-size` property specifies the width of a tab character. Useful in `<pre>` or `<code>` blocks.

**Q459:** What is `max-lines` (as part of `line-clamp`)?
**A459:** `max-lines` specifies the maximum number of lines before text is truncated, often with `text-overflow: ellipsis;`. (Part of `line-clamp` which has mixed/prefixed browser support).

**Q460:** What is the `shape-outside` property?
**A460:** `shape-outside` allows content to flow around custom shapes (e.g., a circle, polygon, image alpha channel) instead of just the bounding box of a floated element.

**Q461:** What is `clip-rule` for SVG?
**A461:** `clip-rule` determines how the `clip-path` property interprets filling rules for compound paths, often using `nonzero` or `evenodd` algorithms.

**Q462:** What is `text-combine-upright`?
**A462:** This property combines multiple characters (e.g., numerals) into a single upright character. It's especially useful in vertical writing modes where it can make short horizontal runs of text (like dates or numbers) appear vertically centered within the line.

**Q463:** What is `image-orientation`?
**A463:** `image-orientation` is a CSS property that corrects the orientation of an image as specified by EXIF data from the image file itself.

**Q464:** What is `mix-blend-mode` used for?
**A464:** `mix-blend-mode` defines how an element's content should blend with its direct background (the content behind it). It allows effects similar to Photoshop's blend modes (e.g., `multiply`, `screen`, `overlay`, `difference`).

**Q465:** What is the `scroll-behavior` property?
**A465:** `scroll-behavior` specifies the scrolling behavior for a scroll box (e.g., `auto` for instant, `smooth` for smooth scrolling). Often applied to `html` for smooth page jumps.
` css html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }  `

**Q466:** What is `offset-path`? (From CSS Motion Path)
**A466:** `offset-path` allows an element to be animated along a custom path (defined by SVG path data or basic shapes) rather than just a linear `translate`.

**Q467:** What is `offset-rotate`? (From CSS Motion Path)
**A467:** `offset-rotate` defines how an element rotates relative to the direction of its motion along an `offset-path`.

**Q468:** What is `resize` property and which elements does it apply to?
**A468:** `resize` allows the user to resize an element. It primarily applies to elements with `overflow` set to a value other than `visible` (e.g., `auto`, `scroll`, `hidden`). Most commonly seen on `textarea`.

**Q469:** What is `image-resolution` property?
**A469:** `image-resolution` hints at the intrinsic resolution of an image when rendered. It's mostly experimental and has limited browser support.

**Q470:** What is `font-palette`?
**A470:** `font-palette` is for styling "color fonts" (fonts with embedded color information), allowing you to choose from different defined color palettes within the font.

**Q471:** What is `text-spacing`?
**A471:** `text-spacing` (part of CSS Text Level 4) controls spacing between characters in East Asian text.

**Q472:** What is the `conic-gradient()` function?
**A472:** `conic-gradient()` creates a gradient where the colors rotate around a central point, like a pie chart.
` css background: conic-gradient(red, yellow, green, blue, red);  `

**Q473:** What is `mask-mode`?
**A473:** `mask-mode` defines whether the mask image specified by `mask-image` should be treated as a luminance mask (based on brightness) or an alpha mask (based on transparency).

**Q474:** What is `text-wrap`? (Emerging feature)
**A474:** `text-wrap` (from CSS Text Level 4) specifies how text inside an element is wrapped. `balance` is a common value for it which tries to balance the lines of text.

**Q475:** What is `initial-letter-align`?
**A475:** Specifies how the "initial letter" (drop cap) should be aligned with the text around it.

**Q476:** What is `line-clamp`?
**A476:** `line-clamp` (often prefixed with `-webkit-`) allows you to constrain the contents of a block to a specified number of lines, appending an ellipsis if the content exceeds that limit.
` css -webkit-line-clamp: 3; -webkit-box-orient: vertical; display: -webkit-box; overflow: hidden;  `

**Q477:** What is `filter: drop-shadow()` vs `box-shadow`?
